[{"id":105009,"type":0,"title":"Cacerolazo","text":"To express popular dissent; to overcome fear in repressive settings; to draw wide swaths of the population into active participation in civil disobedience. As the clock struck 8 pm on a Montr\u00e9al spring night in May 2012, a sound rose like crickets at dusk: a metallic tapping in the distance that multiplied and spread until a cacophony of clanging pots and pans filled the air. All over the city, tens of thousands of people took to the streets that night, and for many nights to follow, armed with kitchenware. It was the largest pot-banging protest \u2014 cacerolazo in Spanish, les casseroles in French \u2014 that North America had ever seen.\nAs a protest tactic, the cacerolazo first gained international prominence in the 1970s, emerging as a powerful means of expressing popular dissent under brutal repression in Chile during the U.S.-backed military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. It again came to prominence during Argentina&#8217;s neoliberal financial crisis in 2001. The tactic was widely deployed in Qu\u00e9bec during the student strike in 2012, and again in Turkey the following year during mass protests against widespread government corruption and police repression.\nGiven its auditory force, a cacerolazo of sufficient size can be incredibly effective in drawing people into the streets, and massing them in public spaces. It also costs nothing and requires no previous activist training or skills. A cacerolazo is driven by shared discontent; the tactic is fundamentally participatory and democratic. People can also participate without hitting the streets, just by leaning out their window and banging a pot and pan in solidarity.\nGiven the speed and spontaneity with which the tactic can spread, and the resulting clamor, a successful cacerolazo is disorienting to police forces attempting to control the protests. A cacerolazo protest is versatile and decentralized. It can be deployed during mass street demonstrations, but can also be used as a disruptor, say, for example, at a politician\u2019s press conference, or a corporate luncheon (see TACTIC: Creative disruption). Musically, it can range from a noisy, chaotic free-for-all to more coordinated rhythms. The tactic appeals to all ages and is particularly popular with children, who love banging pots and pans together even more than adults do.\n\nBy Stefan Christoff","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/cacerolazo\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/TA_Cacerolazo_Casseroles-in-Montreal.jpg","links":[100161,100149,100245,100143,100193,100138,100148,200229,200219,200269,200237,200132,200181,300205,300259,300201,300209,400145,400236,500297,200189]},{"id":104800,"type":0,"title":"Legislative theater","text":"Legislative theater takes Augusto Boal\u2019s interactive forum theater exercises from the stage into the real world \u2013 as a tool for proposing and enacting legislative and policy changes at any level of government. In 1992, Augusto Boal, the creator of Theater of the Oppressed (see THEORY: Theater of the Oppressed), was faced with a dilemma. His theater work was an international sensation. Centers for the Theater of the Oppressed were up and running in both France and Brazil, and people all over the world were practicing his ideas. At the same time, he was facing pressure at home in Brazil to run for the position of vereador (a position similar to that of a City Councilor in North America) in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Faced with a choice between the two, Boal decided not to choose. Instead, he combined the two possibilities and passions into one \u2014 and legislative theater was born.\nLegislative theater is essentially a forum theater performance \u2014 a short play about a particular issue or set of issues that ends in a crisis, which the audience is then invited to help solve by taking the place of one of the characters on stage (see TACTIC: Forum theater) \u2014 but with a key difference. The difference is that the audience interventions are followed by a brainstorm and discussion of policies or laws that could help solve some of the problems that came up in the performance, or that could help bring about some of the solutions \u201cspect-actors\u201d (the engaged audience) had offered during the performance. In some iterations of legislative theater, a later step involves mock legislatures being created to debate bills drafted based on the laws or policies previously suggested in the theater exercise.\nBoal\u2019s election campaign literature explained his rationale:\n\u201cI want to make politics but I don&#8217;t want to change my profession \u2014 I am a man of the theater! For me, this was always possible and now it is necessary: theater is political and politics is theater.\u201d\nBoal was one of 42 vereadors elected from a field of 1,000 candidates. Over the next four years, he developed the methods of legislative theater, forming 19 permanent Theater of the Oppressed companies in Rio, and from that work, introducing 30 pieces of legislation. In 13 of these 30 cases, as Boal put it, \u201cdesire became law\u201d and laws were changed based on the proposals that emerged from the exercises.\nTo those who say that theater is nice but has no tangible outcomes, legislative theater may be the answer. Its intent is policy change&#8230; and it boasts all of theater\u2019s educational and artistic virtues to boot!\n\nBy Tracey Mitchell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/legislative-theater\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/TA_Legislative-theater_Boal-in-London-Chambers.jpg","links":[100218,100174,100273,200270,200232,200271,300246,300140]},{"id":104127,"type":0,"title":"Light Brigade","text":"To broadcast a message through collective action; to frame nighttime actions with a key message; to make creative use of overlooked public spaces. Imagine you\u2019re at a nighttime vigil to protest the latest looming war. Candles are lit, speakers share eloquent messages, and suddenly, from a nearby rise overlooking the public square where you\u2019ve gathered, the words WORK FOR PEACE light up the night, each letter several feet tall and swaying independently of the others, because each letter is held up by a different person. This is a Light Brigade in action.\nA Light Brigade is a tactic where activists hold illuminated messages consisting of large lighted letters in public spaces at night. Light Brigades are best used in thoroughfare spaces such as highways and overpasses, iconic structures such as seats of government and monuments, or solemn gatherings such as vigils and marches.\u00a0Light Brigade communications make Twitter look like long-form narrative.\nThe letters, based on simple DIY technology developed by the Overpass Light Brigade out of Milwaukee (with props to Graffiti Research Lab), are lightweight and portable. They consist of off-the-shelf battery-powered LED strings of holiday lights set into corrugated plastic panels, which are then framed for durability.\nOnce the message is decided and the letters are constructed, an Overpass Light Brigade action begins with a social media or email call to action to mobilize volunteer \u201cHolders of the Lights.\u201d\nBecause there are real humans holding the letters, the action is no longer about simply communicating a message, but becomes an act of bearing witness. Distinct from related forms of messaging (see TACTIC: Banner hang and TACTIC: Guerrilla projection), the visibility and accessibility of Light Brigade participants standing together to share a message brings power to the action as well as building a sense of collective empowerment for the participants.\nExamples of the Light Brigade tactic in action include holding the message QUESTION AUSTERITY over a busy highway in Milwaukee as part of a coordinated Twitter campaign explaining the failures and falsehood of austerity economic policy. MONEY \u2260 SPEECH was displayed in coordination with Move To Amend and other campaigns seeking to undo the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cCitizens United\u201d ruling, which gave corporations the legal status of people. Iconic sites have also lent context to messages such as WE HAVE A DREAM and JOBS NOT WAR at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., and I HAVE A DRONE in front of the White House. In front of the capitol building in Madison, Wisconsin, POLICE STATE was held to protest unlawful arrests of activists.\nLight Brigades can add depth and focus to vigils and solemn events, as seen with messages such as PRACTICE PEACE at the vigil for slain Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, or WE SHALL OVERCOME at the Times Square rally in support of Trayvon Martin. Environmental messages such as WATER = LIFE displayed near lakes, rivers, mountains, and shorelines can also add weight and beauty to protests of extractive industries.\nWhile it takes some effort to build multiple letters, the recombinant potential of a collection of letters is virtually endless. It\u2019s very important to document your action (see PRINCIPLE: Do the media\u2019s work for them), as subsequent social media attention can amplify the reach of the message through pictures, video and blog posts. Therefore, be sure to recruit photographers to your group, or get good at your own night-time photography.\n\n\nBy Lane Hall","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/light-brigade\/","links":[100150,100272,100195,100193,100230,100148,100226,100177,200134,200248,200231,200180,200182,200227,300192,300179,300228,300540,400170,400188,504136,200244]},{"id":100239,"type":0,"title":"Prefigurative intervention","text":"To give a glimpse of the Utopia we\u2019re working for; to show how the world could be; to make such a world feel not just possible, but irresistible.

Prefigurative interventions seek to address that imbalance.\nThe lunch counter sit-ins of the U.S. civil rights movement are frequently referenced as defiant, courageous and ultimately successful acts of resistance against America\u2019s Jim Crow-era apartheid. They were certainly that, but they were also profoundly prefigurative. The students\u2019 actions \u2014 mixed-race groups of people violating the law by sitting at lunch counters and demanding to be served \u2014 foreshadowed victory and prefigured the world they wanted to live in: they were enacting the integration they wanted.\nPranks, art interventions, tactical media, alternative festivals and temporary communities, even electoral guerrilla theater, can also be effective ways to prefigure the world we want to live in.\nPrefigurative interventions are direct actions sited at the point of assumption \u2014 where beliefs are made and unmade, and the limits of the possible can be stretched see THEORY: Points of intervention. The goal of a prefigurative intervention is twofold: to offer a compelling glimpse of a possible, and better, future, and also \u2014 slyly or baldly \u2014 to point up the poverty of imagination of the world we actually do live in.\nLike the occupation of Tahrir Square in Egypt and the encampments in public squares across Spain by the Indignados movement, the Occupy encampments across the world are crucibles of prefigurative intervention, providing a space for people to create in microcosm the communitarian and democratic world they want to bring into being. Likewise, the Burning Man art festival works as a temporary autonomous zone where people can live out values, test out ideas and experiment with the future in real time see THEORY: Temporary Autonomous Zone.\nMonthly Critical Mass bike rides prefigure future cities in which bicycles actually hold their own as traffic. Or PARK(ing) Day, in which people in cities across the country put a day\u2019s worth of coins into a parking meter and transform their parking space into a mini-park or jazz lounge or tiny public swimming pool, prefigure a greening of urban space and a reclaimed commons.\nThe Oil Enforcement Agency was a 2006 theatrical action campaign in which environmental activists \u2014 complete with SWAT-team-like caps and badges, posed as agents of a government agency \u2014 one that didn\u2019t exist, but should have. Agents ticketed SUVs, impounded fuel-inefficient vehicles at auto shows and generally modelled a future in which government took climate change seriously.\nIf hope truly is a muscle that we build by exercising, then interventions that prefigure the world we want to live in \u2014 whether by prophetic acts of civil disobedience, the formation of alternative communities or the staging of prankish provocations \u2014 are one of the best ways to work that muscle.\n\nBy Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/prefigurative-intervention\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Prefigurative Intervention\/TA_Prefigurative Intervention_PARKing.jpg","links":[100218,100146,100149,200212,200211,200182,200247,200130,300287,300204,300176,300141,301240,400265,400254,400253,404749,500775,500375,500322,100191,100184,100234,100175,100171,100240,100143,100148,200255,200241,200199,200154,200220,200231,200136,200187,200158,300243,300246,300228,300202,300205,300262,300258,300214,300192,400170,400157,400185,400213,400236,400162,400266,400167,400156]},{"id":100191,"type":0,"title":"Strategic nonviolence","text":"To create a framework for broad-based direct action conducive to building large, inclusive, diverse and effective movements. For over a decade, questions of violence, property destruction and confrontational tactics generally have tended to be debated under the frame diversity of tactics, but the time has come to seek a new frame. Diversity of tactics becomes an easy way to avoid wrestling with questions of strategy and accountability. It lets us off the hook from doing the hard work of debating positions and coming to agreements about how we want to act together. It becomes a code for \u201canything goes,\u201d and makes it impossible for our movements to hold anyone accountable for their actions.\nA framework that might better serve our purposes is one of strategic nonviolent direct action. Within a strategic nonviolence framework, groups make clear agreements about which tactics to use for a given action. This frame is strategic \u2014 it makes no moral judgments about whether or not violence is ever appropriate, it does not demand we commit ourselves to a lifetime of Gandhian pacifism, but it says, \u201cThis is how we agree to act together at this time.\u201d It is active, not passive. It seeks to create a dilemma for the opposition see PRINCIPLE: Put your target in a decision dilemma, and to dramatize the difference between our values and theirs.\nStrategic nonviolent direct action has powerful advantages:\nWe make agreements about what types of action we will take, and hold one another accountable for keeping them. Making agreements is empowering. If I know what to expect in an action, I can make a choice about whether or not to participate. We don\u2019t place unwilling people in the position of being held responsible for acts they did not commit and do not support.\nIn the process of coming to agreements, we listen to each other\u2019s differing viewpoints. We don\u2019t avoid disagreements within our group, but learn to debate freely, passionately and respectfully.\nWe organize openly, without fear, because we stand behind our actions. We may break laws in service to the higher laws of conscience. We don\u2019t seek punishment, nor admit the right of the system to punish us, but we face the potential consequences for our actions with courage and pride.\nBecause we organize openly, we can invite new people into our movements and they can continue to grow. As soon as we institute a security culture in the midst of a mass movement, the movement begins to close in upon itself and to shrink.\nThough a framework of nonviolent direct action does not make us \u201csafe,\u201d it does let us make clear decisions about what kinds of actions we put ourselves at risk for. That said, we can\u2019t control what the police do and they need no direct provocation to attack us see PRINCIPLE: Take risks but take care.\nA framework of strategic nonviolent direct action makes it easy to reject provocation. We know what we\u2019ve agreed to \u2014 and anyone urging other courses of action can be reminded of those agreements or rejected.\nThere\u2019s plenty of room in this struggle for a diversity of movements and a diversity of organizing and actions. Some may choose strict Gandhian nonviolence, others may choose emphatic resistance. But for movements that embrace it, strategic nonviolent direct action is a framework that will allow broad-based movements to grow in diversity and power.\n\nBy starhawk","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/strategic-nonviolence\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Strategic Nonviolence\/TA_Strategic nonviolence_Pepper Spray Davis.jpg","links":[100138,100146,100149,100239,200238,200526,200227,200132,300202,300169,300204,300259,300287,300209,405098,405156,100175,200222,200264,200232,200211,200219,200129,200136,200190,300205,400145,400265,400168]},{"id":100173,"type":0,"title":"Public filibuster","text":"Interrupting or shutting down a hearing or government vote. Many people know about the U.S. Senate\u2019s procedural filibusters, in which a dissenting senator holds the floor to keep a vote from happening. The people\u2019s version, the public filibuster, is no different. When activists face hostile government agencies or hearings that exclude the public, this relatively low-risk tactic injects the public\u2019s voice into an otherwise closed-off process. Confrontational but constructive, it has been adapted by a range of citizen groups.\nIn 2007, for example, a dozen members of Casino-Free Philadelphia decided to use the public filibuster at a Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) meeting. For two years, the PGCB had refused to let members of the public testify at so-called public hearings, but this time the public was going to have its say. One at a time, members stood up and began testifying. Each one was told to be quiet by the chairwoman. A recess was quickly called, and the members who had spoken were escorted out of the building by police and told they would not be allowed to return.\nWhen the board reconvened, the chairwoman warned the remaining members of the group not to interrupt. Naturally, one after another of the members immediately stood up and continued the filibuster. They spoke over the banging gavel of the distressed chairwoman and over the \u201cofficial\u201d testifiers as they coolly tried to continue. Another recess was called, and then another, as the public filibuster continued. Finally, the PGCB shut down the entire meeting. The result: rather than risk another such engagement, the PGCB changed its policy to allow the public to speak at hearings.\nTo an unsympathetic eye, disrupting a meeting can come across as mob rule, especially when poorly done see TACTIC: Creative disruption. The power of the public filibuster depends on carrying out the action in a dignified manner, as well as framing the tactic properly. Calling the action a \u201cpublic filibuster\u201d helps lend the kind of legitimacy recognized by reporters and the broader public.\nWhen planning a public filibuster, be sure to stay positive and respectful. Your tone matters a great deal, and your bearing and presentation should be above reproach. Be honest, expressive, polite and on-message. Focus on the issue at hand, not the person trying to run the meeting. Also, show some compassion for the chairperson, who is used to being in control. This action threatens their power and puts them in an awkward and uncomfortable position.

The first recorded labor strike was a form of occupation: over 3,000 years ago, ancient Egyptian tomb builders from the desert village of Deir el-Medina repeatedly occupied temples following the failure of Pharaoh Ramses III to provide adequate provisions. We see other examples of public occupations that have propelled history forward ever since.\nIn seventeenth-century England, for instance, the Diggers formed a utopian agrarian community on common land. Workers, soldiers and citizens established the Paris Commune in 1871. In the United States, in the Great Upheaval of 1877, striking railway workers and their supporters occupied train yards across the land. A wave of plant occupations in the mid-1930s led to the justly famous Flint sit-down strikes of 1936, which won union recognition for hundreds of thousands of auto workers.\nOccupations are a popular tactic employed by social movements to hold and defend space. Other direct action tactics may also be deployed to support the occupation such as sit-ins, blockades or banner hang; or in some circumstances full-blown occupations have been known to grow out of a smaller tactic, such as a sit-in.\nWhile the term can refer to an oppressor who has invaded or annexed land from a population (\u201coccupied North America\/Turtle Island\u201d or \u201coccupied Palestine\u201d), the tactic of occupation is often used by those same groups to assert their right to that land: for example, the occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969 by Indians of All Tribes, or when the Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota community, American Indian Movement, and Earth First! held a sixteen-month occupation to defend Minnehaha State Park from highway construction slated to desecrate sacred land.\nThe action logic see THEORY\u00a0of many of these occupations is that people are reclaiming space that they are entitled to, thereby highlighting a greater theft. This same action logic can be applied to students taking over a building that should be serving them (for instance, in the late 1960s when African-American students\u00a0occupied university buildings across the U.S., leading to the creation of many African American\/Ethnic Studies departments), or environmentalists defending land that should be held in common, or workers occupying the factory in which they labor.\nWhile occupations can range in style and form, they generally have two key components: 1) a focus on the logistics of maintaining an encampment, semi-permanent rally, or sit-in, which requires meeting needs around food, shelter, defense from police raids, etc., and which can often be a profoundly politicizing experience in its own right, and 2) a public pressure campaign that seeks to put the target in a decision dilemma see PRINCIPLE.\nThe location chosen for an occupation site often determines its success. A number of considerations may factor into the decision, such as symbolic significance, ability to concretely disrupt a target see PRINCIPLE: Make your actions both concrete and communicative, a logistical ability to maintain the occupation, as well as public visibility and technicalities of legal ownership. Historically, occupations have lent themselves to spontaneity, but the enduring ones tend to be well planned.\nGroups like the Landless Workers Movement (MST) and La Via Campesina support communities of peasants in occupying fallow private land and reclaiming it for common use or basic subsistence. In the United States, groups like Take Back the Land apply this same principle to foreclosures, defending housing as a human right see TACTIC: Eviction blockade. In the environmental movement, tree-sits are a common example of occupations being used to defend forests from logging. Squatters movements across Europe have \u201ctaken back\u201d abandoned buildings and repurposed them as homes and social centers with the intention of flying under the radar of authorities until they can lay legal claim to the space.\nOccupations inherently threaten the legitimacy of a target by demonstrating the power-holder\u2019s inability to enforce the status quo. They also serve to expose the arbitrary, and often unjust, nature of private property regimes see THEORY: The commons.\n\nBy Joshua Kahn Russell and Arun Gupta","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/occupation\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Occupation\/TA_Occupation_Flint Strike.gif","links":[100239,100191,100149,100175,100245,100150,200153,200238,200132,200137,200248,200233,200211,200131,200227,200222,300287,300176,300259,300202,300141,300169,300204,400188,500297,100138,200229,200183,300205,400254]},{"id":100207,"type":0,"title":"Invisible theater","text":"To pose a moral dilemma in the midst of everyday life \u2014 this can be particularly useful on a topic that people might normally be \u201ctoo polite\u201d to bring up, such as poverty, racism or homophobia.

Some of these people are actors, the rest, including you, are unwittingly participating in an invisible theater performance.[1]\nInvisible theater is theater that seeks never to be recognized as theater, performed in a public place. The goal is to make the intervention as realistic as possible so that it provokes spontaneous responses. The scene must be loud enough to be heard and noticed by people, but not so loud or conspicuous that it appears staged. Bystanders can and will engage with the scene as if it were real life, because for them it is real life. Invisible theater can thus achieve things that most other theater cannot, removing barriers between performer and spectator and creating very accessible conflictual situations in which people can rethink their assumptions and engage with sensitive issues they might otherwise avoid.\nInvisible theater is one of Augusto Boal\u2019s Theater of the Oppressed techniques, and has been used around the world in many different settings. In New York City in 2003, actors posing as tourists made loud comments about the potential terrorist threat posed by two Muslim women in hijab (also actors) who were taking photos of the Empire State Building. This scene sparked important dialogue about racial profiling and the \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d In other instances, actors posing as customers in restaurants and grocery stores have claimed not to be able to afford their bill, sparking a dialogue with the cashier and nearby customers (some of them also actors) about questions of economic justice.\nInvisible theater requires a significant amount of preparation and rehearsal. The form requires actors to remain in character even when the action goes in unexpected and challenging directions. In its pure form, invisible theater never lets on that it is theater. Unlike other stealth theater forms like guerrilla theater, Yes Men-style hoaxes or Improv Everywhere pranks, there is never \u201ca reveal.\u201d People who encounter an invisible theater performance should experience it as reality and forever after think it was real.\n\n\n\t[1] This scenario was played out on the ABC News Show What Would You Do? that uses a version of invisible theater to generate discussion. While the show breaks the usual rules of invisible theater by surreptitiously filming the scene and eventually telling those present that the scene is not real, it is nevertheless a good introduction to the power and possibility of invisible theater.  &#x21A9;\nBy Tracey Mitchell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/invisible-theater\/","links":[100273,100174,200154,200241,200126,200220,200227,200526,300140,400160,400213,500346,100193,200264,200219,200183,300243,400165]},{"id":100184,"type":0,"title":"Identity correction","text":"To embarrass your target; to correct the public record; to expose corporate malfeasance; to reframe an issue.

When the Yes Men impersonated Dow Chemical on the twentieth anniversary of the Bhopal catastrophe and announced on Dow\u2019s behalf that it was finally taking responsibility for the disaster see CASE: Dow Chemical apologizes for Bhopal; or when U.S. Uncut activists announced that GE was paying its 2010 taxes after all see TACTIC: Hoax; or when activists impersonating French officials announced that Haiti\u2019s debt \u2014 imposed when Haiti won independence from France, to compensate French slaveowners for their lost \u201cproperty\u201d \u2014 would at long last be forgiven; or when environmental activists impersonated Canada (in one case) or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (in another) and announced surprising and wonderful things\u2026 In all these cases, the consequences were immediate: voluminous news reports about the unlikely turn of events (and, in the Dow and GE cases, giant temporary drops in each company\u2019s stock value).

On April 15, 2011, when General Electric announced that the company would return its illegitimate (but legal) $3.2 billion tax refund, and also lobby to close the sort of corporate tax loopholes that had allowed them to dodge taxes in the first place, it seemed too good to be true. When was the last time a major American corporation took such a moral leadership role?\nUm, never! The announcement was a hoax, created by the tax fairness group U.S. Uncut, with some help from The Yes Lab. On this occasion, the core of the action was a simple press release that masqueraded as a real one from General Electric. An Associated Press writer, as eager as the rest of America to believe that such a thing could be true, picked it up and sent it over the wire. It only took minutes to be debunked, but in the media storm it created (including a temporary $3 billion plunge in GE stock value), U.S. Uncut was able to make their point, at a scale usually only granted to those who can pay for the privilege.\nHoaxes are one way for activists to \u201cbuy\u201d some airtime that they can\u2019t afford. Instead of complaining that the press is set up to give voice to the interests of the powerful see THEORY: Propaganda model, the hoax puts that bias to work. By speaking as the powerful, and telling a more interesting story than the powerful usually do, one can often commandeer a pretty big soapbox. After the hoax is revealed (usually within minutes or hours) then the activists can explain themselves to the public in their own true voices, with the help of the usually massive numbers of journalists all stirred up by the trick that\u2019s just been played on the powerful.\nIt is generally best to reveal a hoax promptly. The ultimate goal here is more truth for more people. At the Yes Lab, we have an ethos: Never leave a lie on the table. This ethos is the opposite MO of those in power. The grand hoaxes they perpetrate on the people \u2014 everything from simple greenwashing campaigns to complex conspiracies to subvert democracy[1] \u2014 are never meant to be debunked. Activists, on the other hand, generally reveal their hoaxes at the earliest opportunity. Speaking of which, the epigraph for this entry is not from Sun Tzu. It\u2019s from the DVD box of The Yes Men Fix the World.\n\n\n\t[1] In 1991 the PR company Hill and Knowlton created a fake story on behalf of the Kuwaiti government about Iraqi soldiers taking premature babies out of incubators after the invasions of Kuwait.

A flash mob is an unrehearsed, spontaneous, contagious, and dispersed mass action. Flash mobs first emerged in 2003 as a form of participatory performance art, with groups of people using email, blogs, text messages, and Twitter to arrange to meet and perform some kind of playful activity in a public location.[1] More recently, activists have begun to harness the political potential of flash mobs for organizing spontaneous mass actions on short notice.\nFlash mobs have recently become a powerful tactic for political protest, particularly under repressive conditions. In the midst of a harsh crackdown on protests in Belarus in 2011, for instance, dissidents calling themselves \u201cRevolution through the Social Network\u201d began organizing impromptu demonstrations where protesters would simply gather in public spaces and clap their hands in unison.[2] The result was the bewildering sight of secret police brutally arresting people for the simple act of clapping their hands \u2014 a powerful challenge to the legitimacy of an increasingly irrational regime.\nThe overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt also involved flash-mob-like tactics, with organizers calling for protesters to gather initially in alleys and other protected spaces for safety before moving into the streets in larger and larger numbers. Blogger Patrick Meier explains the thinking behind this approach:\nStarting small and away from the main protests is a safe way to pool protesters together. It\u2019s also about creating an iterative approach to a \u201cstrength in numbers\u201d dynamic. As more people crowd the smaller streets, this gives a sense of momentum and confidence. Starting in alleyways localizes the initiative. People are likely neighbors and join because they see their friend or sister out in the street.[3]\nAnother example of effective use of the flash mob tactic is UK Uncut. In October 2010, one week after the British government announced massive cuts to public services, seventy people occupied a Vodaphone store in London to draw attention to the company\u2019s record of unpaid taxes. The idea quickly went viral: within three days, over thirty Vodaphone stores had been shut down around the country by flash mobs organizing over Twitter using the hashtag #ukuncut.\nThe revolutionary potential for dispersed, coordinated action using flash mob tactics has only begun to be realized. As Micah White wrote in Adbusters:\nFun, easy to organize, and resistant to both infiltration and preemption because of their friend-to-friend network topology, flash mobs are positioned to be the next popular tactic with revolutionary potential. . . . With flash mobs, activists have the potential to swarm capitalism globally.[4]\n\n\n\t[1] The understanding of \u201cflash mobs\u201d that has filtered into popular culture is generally limited to surprise choreographed dance routines performed in public. But for organizing purposes, those carefully choreographed stunts are better described as \u201cguerrilla\u201d than \u201cflash\u201d see TACTIC: Guerrilla musicals. The distinct characteristics of a flash mob \u2014 an unrehearsed, spontaneous, contagious, and dispersed mass action \u2014 has its own unique advantages, and requires a different set of organizing principles than a surprise choreographed dance routine requires. &#x21A9;\n\t[2] \u201cDozens Arrested in Belarus \u2018Clapping\u2019 Protest,\u201d Al Jazeera English, July 3, 2011. &#x21A9;\n\t[3] \u201cCivil Resistance Tactics Used in Egypt\u2019s Revolution,\u201d irevolution, Feb. 7, 2011. http:\/\/irevolution.net\/2011\/02\/27\/tactics-egypt-revolution-jan25. &#x21A9;\n\t[4] Micah White, \u201cTo the Barricades,\u201d Adbusters 94 (March\/April 2011). &#x21A9;\nBy Dave Oswald Mitchell and Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/flash-mob\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Flash Mob\/PillowFight_WallStreet.jpg","links":[105009,104127,100161,100207,100138,100148,200189,200270,200219,200131,200229,300201,300209,404842,405156,500346,500297,500294,500350,500389,100195,200223,200231,200134,200158,300141,300228,300179,300208,400210,400236]},{"id":100175,"type":0,"title":"Eviction blockade","text":"To organize a strong show of physical resistance to an unjust eviction; to force a moral confrontation with a system that operates amorally. It was a cold March morning in Rochester, NY, when the city marshal approached 9 Ravenwood Avenue in an attempt to carry out what he thought would be a routine eviction. Instead, he was met with eighty people holding signs and banners protesting the foreclosure and imminent displacement of the Lennon-Griffin family, including grandmother Catherine Lennon, her three daughters, and eight small grandchildren. Four people were chained to the stairs of the house. Next to them was a large sign that read, \u201cWe shall not be moved.\u201d The eviction blockade had been organized by the anti-poverty group Take Back the Land.\nThe marshal left as quickly as he came, later saying, \u201cthis is not what I signed up for.\u201d He would not return for weeks.\nEviction blockades are as old as evictions themselves, and like evictions, they tend to surge in numbers in times of economic hardship. In response to the Great Depression in the U.S., for instance, the National Unemployment Council \u2014 founded in Chicago in\u00a01930 \u2014 formed hundreds of local branches to organize eviction blockades across the country. From January to June 1932, 185,794 families in New York City received eviction notices, and the Unemployment Council helped an estimated 77,000 of those families keep their homes. The eviction blockade can be an extraordinarily effective tactic when it has community support, when it is embedded within a larger movement or campaign, and when it is linked to winnable demands.\nIn the case of the Lennon-Griffin family, mortgage holder Fannie Mae eventually pushed the City of Rochester to conduct a SWAT-like operation to break the blockade and forcibly remove the family. The eviction created a terrifying spectacle: Special Operations officers stormed the house, crime scene tape was wrapped around the area, traffic enforcement officers blocked access by supporters and media. The police arrested seven people, including an elderly neighbor across the street in her pajamas. Though the eviction went ahead, the family\u2019s plight and the actions and goals of the movement were elevated to a new prominence, and more families in the community stepped forward to defend their homes with eviction blockades. The eviction cost the city an estimated $9,000 \u2014 one-third the value of the original mortgage.\nThe negative publicity of breaking a community-supported eviction blockade tends to make local governments and banks more reticent to repeat violent evictions in the future. For example, just five weeks after Catherine Lennon was evicted, she publicly moved back into her house without the bank\u2019s permission and with zero police interference.[1]\nIn the wake of a property bubble that saw the banks bailed out while homeowners were left to fend for themselves, the tactic is an increasingly effective one for social movements everywhere. In the summer of 2011 the Indignados movement in Spain shifted its actions from public squares to neighborhoods, organizing eviction blockades across the country. Six months later, the Occupy movement followed suit. The organizing potential for such actions is as vast as the injustice it seeks to confront.\n\n\n\t[1] As of December 2011, Catherine Lennon and her family were still in their home and it seemed likely the family will find a permanent settlement with Fannie Mae and Bank of America to stay in their home. &#x21A9;\nBy Ryan Acuff","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/eviction-blockade\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Eviction Blockade\/KCREEDON_Marshall_Cooper_10.17.10.jpg","links":[100173,100146,100245,100149,100128,100239,100191,200221,200227,200232,200220,200132,200242,200222,200238,200526,300287,300205,300202,300262,300176,300214,100161,300209,300203,300258]},{"id":100177,"type":0,"title":"D\u00e9tournement\/Culture jamming","text":"Altering the meaning of a target\u2019s messaging or brand; packaging critical messages as highly contagious media viruses. Urban living involves a daily onslaught of advertisements, corporate art, and mass-mediated popular culture see THEORY: Society of the spectacle. As oppressive and alienating as this spectacle may be, its very ubiquity offers plentiful opportunities for semiotic jiu-jitsu and creative disruption. Subversive and marginalized ideas can spread contagiously by reappropriating artifacts drawn from popular media and injecting them with radical connotations.\nThis technique is known as d\u00e9tournement. Popularized by Guy Debord and the Situationists, the term is borrowed from French and roughly translates to \u201coverturning\u201d or \u201cderailment.\u201d D\u00e9tournement appropriates and alters an existing media artifact, one that the intended audience is already familiar with, in order to give it a new, subversive meaning.\nIn many cases, the intent is to criticize the appropriated artifact. For instance, the neo-Situationist magazine Adbusters has created American flags bearing corporate logos in place of stars. The traditional flag, which is often used to quash dissent by equating America with liberty and progress see THEORY: Floating signifier, is made to communicate its own critique: corporations, not the people, rule America. Similarly, an Adbusters \u201csubvertisement\u201d for Camel cigarettes, perfectly rendered in the style and lettering of real Camel advertisements, depicts a bald Joe Chemo in a hospital bed.\nD\u00e9tournement works because humans are creatures of habit who think in images, feel our way through life, and often rely on familiarity and comfort as the final arbiters of truth see PRINCIPLE: Think narratively. Rational arguments and earnest appeals to morality may prove less effective than a carefully planned d\u00e9tournement that bypasses the audience\u2019s mental filters by mimicking familiar cultural symbols, then disrupting them.\nFor instance, UC Davis police officer Lt. John Pike began to pop up in some unexpected places after he was captured on film casually pepper spraying students during a peaceful protest. One image depicted Lt. Pike walking through John Trumbull\u2019s classic painting The Declaration of Independence and pepper spraying America\u2019s founding document, while another depicted him in Georges Seurat\u2019s A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, pepper spraying a woman lounging in the grass. These images, and other d\u00e9tournements of \u201cpepper spray cop,\u201d are some of the most visible critiques of police brutality in recent American history.[1]\nIn addition to its instrumental, critical function, d\u00e9tournement has an important humanistic function. D\u00e9tournement can be used to disrupt the flow of the media spectacle and, ultimately, to rob it of its power. Advertisements start to feel less like battering rams of consumerism and more like the raw materials for art and critical reflection. Advertising firms may still generate much of culture\u2019s raw content, but through d\u00e9tournement and related culture jamming tactics, we can reclaim a bit of autonomy from the mass-mediated hall of mirrors that we live in, and find artful ways to talk back to the spectacle and use its artifacts to amplify our own voices.\n\n\n\n\n\t[1] It is worth noting that the \u201cpepper spray cop\u201d meme emerged out of an incident in which the victims of police brutality were mostly white college students. By contrast, the brutal murder of Oscar Grant, a young black man, by BART police officer Johannes Mehserle, which was also filmed, generated nowhere near the same level of outrage. D\u00e9tournement, as a communicative strategy that closely mimics dominant culture, often replicates\u2014or even relies on\u2014oppressive cultural assumptions and biases. &#x21A9;\nBy Zack Malitz","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/detournementculture-jamming\/","links":[104127,100184,100234,100226,100272,200130,200154,200182,200139,200158,200271,200264,200241,200153,200231,201558,300235,300208,300228,300206,300192,300204,300540,400144,400166,400267,400165,400156,400170,404604,404842,500381,500294,500306,500310,500333,500335,500340,500373,500377,100218,100150,200255,200227,300243,300142,400210,400252,400162]},{"id":100171,"type":0,"title":"Trek","text":"To link disparate locations that seek to have impact on a common issue; to model alternative community; to demonstrate commitment to a cause through endurance; to physically embody a pathway to an alternative.

Each step of our path embodies the message.\nPeople\u2019s resistance stories are full of walks, treks, sea voyages and even flights. Over the millennia of human existence, entire communities have packed up and voted with their feet, moving away from untenable situations to more fertile lands. In the last century, extended marches have been used broadly and strategically as a platform for outreach and mobilization, and as a visible expression of issues.\nIndia\u2019s Salt March of 1932 is likely the best-known example of a mass, many-day trek see CASE: The Salt March. Gandhi conceived of this march as a living lesson for India, creating a community, literally one step at a time, that both supported and embodied an independent India.\nMany other treks have followed suit, usually with a commitment to demonstrate an ideal or alternative way of living. The 1986 Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament flourished during its cross-continental trek, arriving in Washington, D.C., with 1,500 marchers and thousands more supporters. In the course of the 3,700 logged miles, the marchers not only educated and agitated for action on nuclear disarmament, but also built a participatory mobile city.\nNot all treks model alternative social or living structures; some focus on specific strategic functions of the tactic itself. In 2010, four immigrant students embarked on a 1,500-mile march to Washington, D.C., to support immediate passage of the DREAM (Development, Relief and Education of Alien Minors) Act and a moratorium on deportations of eligible students. The Trail of Dreams see CASE: Trail of Dreams embodied the impossible hurdles placed on the path to success of immigrants in the USA.\nMany forms of transportation, from bicycles to trains and even sailboats, have been used in treks. In the 1935 On-to-Ottawa trek, hundreds of unemployed Canadian workers boarded boxcars in Vancouver to take their grievances to the national capital. Their basic demands proved so threatening to the government that they were physically stopped from reaching Ottawa, but the unrest that fueled their trek soon brought down the conservative government. In 1989, a citizen diplomatic venture, the Soviet American Sail, navigated a 156&#8242; schooner from NYC to Leningrad to bring home the counter-Cold War and environmental message, \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d The trek tactic can prove a potent tool in focusing attention on an issue.\n\nBy Nadine Bloch","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/trek\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Trek\/TA_Trek_the line.jpg","links":[100239,100230,100186,200231,200224,200181,200154,300287,300204,300259,300208,400265,400157,500042,500040,200222,200232,200130,300203,400196]},{"id":100240,"type":0,"title":"Nonviolent search and seizure","text":"Does the government or a polluting corporation have hidden documents or secret plans? Liberate them! The tactic of nonviolent search and seizure rests on the idea that any information that impacts the public but is being hidden from them should be liberated. It\u2019s a direct action tactic that involves taking matters into our own hands by showing up with a \u201ccitizens\u2019 search warrant\u201d and attempting, nonviolently, to liberate the documents in question. Even though the tactic is unlikely to succeed directly, the ensuing controversy (and possible arrests) can nonetheless bring the secret documents to the public\u2019s attention. In several high-profile cases, the successful application of the tactic has created enough outcry that the target has been forced to make the documents public.\nThe tactic originated in 2001, when Philippe Duhamel, a trainer and organizer based in Montr\u00e9al, Canada, thought back to Gandhi\u2019s strategy of nonviolent raids on colonial salt deposits. Duhamel was working with Operation SalAMI\u2019s campaign to expose the secretive Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA) trade agreement being negotiated. Even senators and members of parliament could not see the negotiating texts \u2014 only key CEOs and the leaders of participating nations. Decrying the anti-democratic nature of the negotiations, Duhamel decided to reinvent Gandhi\u2019s open, transparent raids.\nWeeks ahead of the Qu\u00e9bec City summit, Operation SalAMI announced it would attempt to \u201cliberate\u201d the texts for public scrutiny. On the day of the action, wave after wave of participants approached the police barricades erected (for their benefit) around the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Each wave read aloud a citizens\u2019 search warrant: \u201cHello, my name is ____. Access to information is basic to democracy. Without that information we cannot have a meaningful public debate. We ask the police to do their job and help us search for the texts. Please let me through.\u201d\nThe first wave went over and was promptly arrested. Over several hours, eighty people \u2014 some dressed as Robin Hood \u2014 climbed over the fence and attempted to liberate the documents. Their action was their message see THEORY: Action logic.\nAs the public saw the lengths the government and corporations were going to hide the texts, public outrage mounted until eventually the Canadian government broke down and released the texts. Exposed to public scrutiny as the corporate coup d\u2019\u00e9tat it was, the FTAA never moved forward.\nNonviolent search and seizure has since been used successfully by other groups and campaigns, including the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and Casino-Free Philadelphia, which won the release of 95% of the documents they had sought to liberate with only fourteen arrests, showing the tactic can be effective on a small scale.\n\nBy Daniel Hunter","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/nonviolent-search-and-seizure\/","links":[100149,100138,100239,200222,200238,300287,300204,300176,500366,200247,200227,200233,200132,200190,300203,400168]},{"id":100226,"type":0,"title":"Media-jacking","text":"To undermine your opposition\u2019s narrative by hijacking their event; to draw attention to your side of the story; to capitalize on your target\u2019s media presence; to reframe an issue; to be a jackass.

Politicians, corporations and lobbyists have much bigger PR budgets and name-brand draw to attract press to their staged media events. Through well-planned creative interventions, however, you can refocus things and highlight a different side the story.\nThere are a few different ways to design a successful media-jacking. The first is simply commandeering the media. One of the most literal (and bold) examples of this occurred in 1991 during the first Gulf War, when the anti-AIDS organization ACT UP burst into a CBS TV studio during a live primetime news broadcast and took over the set, chanting \u201cFight AIDS, not Arabs.\u201d\nAnother option is to use your opposition\u2019s platform to tell your own story. In 2007, Kleenex ran an expensive PR stunt where they interviewed people on the street for a commercial they were making, getting participants to cry and say, \u201cI need a Kleenex.\u201d Greenpeace activists stealthily lined up to be interviewed, crying instead because Kleenex was clear-cutting old growth forests to make their tissues. They successfully shut down the shoot for the rest of the day, and a video of the action went viral.\nSophisticated media-jacking uses your target\u2019s own story against them, undermining them at the point of assumption see THEORY: Points of intervention. For example, when activists from United for a Fair Economy hijacked the Republican stunt on Tax Day 1998 see CASE: Whose Tea Party?, they turned the message \u201ctaxes = oppression\u201d on its head, to show instead that tax breaks for the rich are destroying working families\u00a0see PRINCIPLE: Reframe.\nSimilarly, in 2006, activists with the Rainforest Action Network made fake press passes, put on suits and snuck into the Los Angeles Auto Show. Rick Wagoner, the CEO of General Motors, was giving a keynote address about how \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d GM\u2019s cars are. The speech was bullshit, but rather than saying it was bullshit, RAN activists stepped on to the stage and up to the mic, pretending to be the emcees see PRINCIPLE: Use the Jedi mind trick. They congratulated Wagoner, then told the audience that they were pleased to announce that GM was prepared to commit in writing to the promises he\u2019d just made, and unfurled an oversized \u201cpledge\u201d that they asked him to sign.

Most of us have also been inspired by a great nonviolent direct action. When individuals or small teams decide to creatively throw themselves upon the gears of the machine, it can detonate powerful mind bombs in our psyches.\nBut when you bring the two together, and thousands of folks from all walks of life collaborate in a mass street action, that\u2019s when magic and movements happen. Movements do mass actions. And you need a highly functioning and energized movement in order to repeatedly pull off smart mass actions in an escalating struggle for change.\nIn the spring of 2011, a million Egyptians took to the streets, occupied Tahrir Square, fought off wave after wave of security forces, and after eighteen eventful and often bloody days, forced President Hosni Mubarak from office. In 1999, 70,000 took to the streets of Seattle and nonviolently shut down the WTO Ministerial meeting, the world\u2019s largest business meeting. In 2010, 3,000 trade unionists and their allies formed a \u201cCitizens\u2019 Posse\u201d and encircled a downtown D.C. hotel full of insurance industry lobbyists for a day in a show of force during the closing weeks of America\u2019s epic health care reform fight.\nIn spite of the differences here in scale, duration, political importance, targets and tactics, all three of these mass street actions succeeded in their goals because they all shared a few key ingredients:\n\u2022 they disrupted business as usual;\n\u2022 they had a clear motive and story;\n\u2022 \u0007they used disciplined nonviolence and focused militancy;\n\u2022 \u0007and they offered an easy way for individuals to participate.\nA mass street action can\u2019t really be choreographed; it\u2019s too big to direct by shouting through a megaphone \u2014 instead, it needs to be largely self-organizing. To work, though, it needs a shared framework, mode of action or rough script to both facilitate self-organizing and maintain the coherence of the overall action see PRINCIPLE: Simple rules can have grand results.\nTahrir didn\u2019t need a script. It needed a call to congregate in public spaces.\nThe movement that shut down the WTO was built around a loose coalition, held together by a horizontally democratic spokescouncil. It agreed on a broad messaging frame and laid down some tactical ground rules (e.g. an agreement on nonviolence, specific responsibilities for each cluster of affinity groups, etc.). It was not choreographed, it was chaotic; decentralized but connected.\nThe Citizens\u2019 Posse action was tightly scripted. Coalition partners designed and agreed on the action frame up front. It needed a tighter script because the action relied more on theater and story than on an actual shutdown of the target. Even though it was primarily a communicative action, it felt like a concrete one because the theater itself was militant, and participants were given a powerful role to play in it see PRINCIPLE: Make your actions both concrete and communicative.\n\nBy John Sellers and Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/mass-street-action\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Mass Street Action\/TA_Mass Street Action_Tahrir Flag.jpg","links":[105009,100191,100193,100240,100245,100146,200132,200222,200270,200229,200129,200131,200130,300287,300202,400145,400168,400236,400265,404842,405098,500297,500285,500358,500393,100272,100143,100149,100198,200223,200136,200183,300201,300257,300169,300259,400172,400170,400188,400251,400256,400196,400185,400167,400144]},{"id":100127,"type":0,"title":"Infiltration","text":"To learn from, expose, or disrupt the meetings of the powerful.

Maybe simply to see what\u2019s going on, or to play a trick of some sort. You might not even know in advance what the trick will be. In 2004, Mike Bonnano and I snuck into the Heritage Foundation luncheon for conservative think tanks just to get acquainted with that world, and on the spur of the moment, seeing Ed Meese sitting next to the podium, I stepped up to the unguarded microphone and proceeded to nominate him for President.

Image theater, a social change tool developed by Augusto Boal, is one of the more widely used forms of Theater of the Oppressed, in which activists, students or any group are invited to form statues that represent a moment in time of an oppressive situation. The image can then serve as a springboard for critical group reflection in order to both understand the situation better and to try out possible \u201csolutions.\u201d Through the process of creating and working with the image, participants can decode the situation, dissecting each character\u2019s personality, motivation and range of possible actions. Insofar as the participants identify with the characters, they can explore possible actions that they themselves can take in their lives.\nImage theater is similar to forum theater in every way, except that everyone is holding still. This allows for both faster development and use of the process: whereas forum theater often involves a small team that develops and rehearses a skit for months, image theater can be created on the spot, collaboratively. In this way, image theater is an incredibly accessible tool to use in trainings, strategy development and direct actions.\nFor example, at a 2005 rally to support a disruption of a Chevron shareholder meeting in San Rafael, California, all demonstrators present were invited to form an image to depict the entire oil industry, including the characters who benefit from it, are oppressed by it, or are bystanders of it. Portrayed in the image were drivers, oil tycoons, media, and impacted communities (people from Nigeria and Ecuador were present to represent themselves). Even water and the Earth were included as characters. Once people were satisfied that the image represented reality, they shared their character\u2019s thoughts and motivations. The few people left in the rally who were not part of the image were then asked to take ten seconds each to intervene in the image in an attempt to transform the oil industry by reshaping the characters whom they believed were the critical agents of change. Everyone could see plainly what actions could or could not get us to the \u201cideal image.\u201d Within twenty-five minutes, the group had arrived at goals, possible tactics and next steps.\nWhile image theater starts with a frozen image, it quickly moves toward interventions by participants, acting in character, to collaboratively and spontaneously name their oppression and its source, and then explore courses of action. The final stage is to reflect on what happened with participants and, if appropriate, write up the actions that seem most viable.\n\nBy Levana Saxon","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/image-theater\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/boal.jpg","links":[104800,100207,100234,100273,200268,200126,200271,300140,300246,300540,100230,200181,200158,300261]},{"id":100195,"type":0,"title":"Human banner","text":"To make a single, unified statement with thousands of people. There\u2019s no law saying that the revolution can\u2019t be fun \u2014 and human banners are excruciatingly fun. No chanting, no harangues; just hundreds of people using their bodies to form enormous words or an image in order to send a message.\nI\u2019ve helped create ten human banners, with crowds ranging from 300 to 1,500. Each event was powerful, cathartic, and the feedback was always something along the lines of: \u201cThe most enjoyable, most fun, best demonstration I\u2019ve ever been to!\u201d\nThe human banner is a powerful, expressive tactic. It has some of the political virtues of a rally: it turns out numbers that physically demonstrate public support and the movement\u2019s ability to mobilize, but it does so with elegance, like a work of art.\nIt works well for media coverage, too. Journalists need fresh story angles and compelling visuals, and the human banner delivers: it\u2019s unusual, remarkable, notable, people-powered, and made up of a thousand individual human interest stories. And when composed correctly, it delivers the money shot the media is always looking for: a single iconic photo that speaks for itself, that tells the whole story on its own see THEORY: Action logic.\nA human banner can be spur of the moment \u2014 a milling crowd can be quickly arranged and photographed from a nearby building or lamppost \u2014 but conscientious planning can produce staggering works of aerial art.\nHere are some things to keep in mind when planning your human banner:\nThe slogan\/image: Your image needs to communicate your message concisely and powerfully. Words and symbols are easiest to lay out, pictures trickier. You want viewers to get your message on first blink, and gasp at its beauty, audacity, and clarity.\nThe site: An iconic background anchors your photo to a place. Murals can be created on sand (etch the outlines before the crowd arrives), on grass (mark it with ropes or string), on pavement (chalk). A football field-sized area works well. My preferred font size for lettering is 100 feet tall, ten feet wide.\nPhotography: Video is nice, but getting at least one great photo is your goal. A helicopter gives optimal photographic maneuverability, but other possibilities include small planes, tall buildings, cranes and camera-balloons.\nCrowd: You\u2019ll definitely want enough folks to fill in your lettering, plus a cadre of event volunteers. Pre-registration prevents last-minute scrambling \u2014 or, worse, a \u201cthin,\u201d scraggly image. Focus on designing an event you\u2019d be excited to attend.

Guerrilla projection, pioneered by artists and advertisers, has been increasingly embraced by activists in recent years as a new medium for delivering messages. The advantages are obvious: with a single high-powered projector, you can turn the side of a building into a huge advertisement for your cause, plastering your message on a spot that would otherwise be out of reach. It\u2019s legally kosher, relatively cheap and risk free compared to, say, trespassing onto a building\u2019s roof to hang a banner off of it. Most importantly, it\u2019s visually powerful: you can literally shine a light on the opposition.\nProjections can be low-fi or hi-fi; mobile or stable. Two jerry-riggers can do one out of the back of their car to capture a quick hit-and-run photo op, or a professional VJ can project from a more stable plug-in location to entertain a crowd of thousands see CASE: 99% bat signal. They\u2019re also a perfect tactic for rebranding your target. Greenpeace projected a huge cartoon \u201cKABLOOM\u201d onto the side of a nuclear reactor to remind people how dangerous nuclear power can be, and a \u201cWe have nuclear weapons on board\u201d onto a nuclear equipped aircraft carrier that was refusing to acknowledge it. In 1993, the Academy Award-winning documentary, \u201cDeadly Deception,\u201d was projected directly onto the San Francisco TV station that was refusing to air it, while hundreds watched, eating popcorn. Under pressure, the station relented and aired the film.\nMuch of the power of projections is in the medium itself. Unlike hanging a banner, a projection can move and change, and even be interactive. With a medium so versatile, why limit yourself to static slogans? On the eve of the Great American Smokeout in 1994, INFACT hit the Philip Morris building in New York with a running count of the number of children addicted to cigarettes. With simple online tools, your projection can become interactive and crowd-sourced. Supporters on the street \u2014 or a continent away \u2014 can text, tweet or email in their own messages to be projected in real time. With a laser pointer, people on the street can write messages to others inside a building, whether they\u2019re friends and family in jail or a CEO in his corner office.\nProjections help us upend the power dynamic. The buildings of the powerful can feel so big and our voices and protest signs so small. But when a huge \u201c99%\u201d bat signal lights up the night sky, or you see your own handwriting scrawled across a corporate HQ in real time, it begins to level the playing field.

One-day general strikes, like those that took place in the UK and Oakland in November 2011, are primarily symbolic protests, more focused on making a political point than creating real economic pressure. To harness the tactic\u2019s true potential, general strikes need to escalate from symbolic one-day protests to ongoing actions that last days and potentially weeks, with a clear goal of inflicting both economic and political damage until the strikers\u2019 demands are met.\nStrikes can be a powerful weapon for shifting the balance of power in workplaces and points of production. By withholding their labor and stopping work from continuing, generations of workers over the last 150 years have won better wages, working conditions, and basic bargaining rights.\nIt is too easy, however, to romanticize the idea of strikes and general strikes. Due to the increasing concentration of transnational corporate power and various laws limiting workers rights, most strikes in the United States are now small and rarely successful rearguard actions to resist wage and benefit cuts. Workers need to creatively reinvent the tactic if strikes are again going to be an effective weapon to win justice. In particular, workers need to recognize, and harness, the power of general and cross-industry strikes.\nThe citywide general strikes of janitors in Los Angles (2000), Boston (2002) and Houston (2006) are one example of how an industry-wide general strike successfully forced powerful corporations hiding behind cleaning subcontractors to meet the demands of tens of thousands of striking janitors. Undocumented immigrant janitors were able to use sit-ins, street blockades and nonviolent civil disobedience, backed by supporters around the world, to build movements that could win. At various points, striking workers and their supporters effectively shut down business-as-usual in the business districts of the cities. The strikes, pitting poor janitors against rich landlords, won massive public support and saw the workers\u2019 demands met.\nKey to the success was the fact that striking janitors continued to escalate their tactics. Instead of just engaging in picketing at their work site, each janitor, liberated from work by the strike, became a full-time organizer, campaigning against the corporations and politicians that control and profit from the real estate industry the workers were targeting. In Los Angeles, that meant literally thousands of striker\/organizers working full-time, day in and day out, organizing demonstrations that shut down streets and occupied office buildings while mobilizing community and ecumenical support.\nThe striking janitors learned firsthand that small, isolated strikes are rarely effective, but that going on a citywide general strike, even in large numbers, doesn\u2019t alone lead to victory either. To win, strikers need to have a clear understanding of the target and its vulnerabilities, and develop a plan to exploit those vulnerabilities. No one action or tactic will provide enough pressure. There needs to be constant, creative and courageous escalation.\n\nBy Stephen Lerner","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/general-strike\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC General Strike\/TA_General Strike_Sabo Cat.jpg","links":[105009,100138,100239,100149,100245,200260,200232,200237,200132,200137,300204,300243,300209,300263,400196,400188,400172,100128,200222,200136,300169,300259,300205,300214]},{"id":100273,"type":0,"title":"Forum theater","text":"Forum theater is a tool for exploring and rehearsing possible actions that people can take to transform their world. It\u2019s often used both in preparation to taking action and in anti-oppression workshops. Forum theater is one of the more commonly used tools from Theater of the Oppressed. It begins with the crafting and performance of a short play that dramatizes real situations faced by the participants and that ends with the protagonist(s) being oppressed. After the first performance, the play or scene is repeated with one crucial difference: the spectators become \u201cspect-actors\u201d and can at any point yell \u201cfreeze\u201d and take the place of an actor to attempt to transform the outcome. Forum theater is an exercise in democracy in which anyone can speak and anyone can act.\nOne of the first things that spect-actors realize is that, as in life, if they don\u2019t intervene, nothing will change. The next thing spect-actors find is that doing \u201csomething\u201d is not enough, it must be a strategic something. The people acting as oppressors on stage will maintain their oppression until they are authentically stopped \u2014 and just like in life, stopping them isn\u2019t easy. Forum theater thus becomes a laboratory to experiment with different courses of action.\nThe protagonists should be characters that all or most of the people in the room can identify with, so that when they intervene, they are rehearsing their own action. The point is not to show what we think other people should do \u2014 it is not theater of advice. The point is to discover what we can do.\nForum theater is facilitated by someone called a Joker, who engages the spect-actors both on and off stage in dialogue throughout the process. After an intervention, the Joker may ask, \u201cDid this work?\u201d, \u201cWas this realistic?\u201d, \u201cCan you do this in real life?\u201d\nForum theater was developed in a context in which it was very clear what the oppression was, who was oppressed and who the oppressors were: its originator, Augusto Boal, was living in exile from the Brazilian military dictatorship, and social movements across the continent were struggling against harsh military repression. Since then, the technique has been adapted to countless other contexts around the world, as practitioners seek to grapple with the complicated power relationships of more diverse groups of people. Often interventions will uncover multiple layers of power, dramatizing characters who are simultaneously oppressed and oppressing others.\nForum theater is an effective tool of creative activism, useful for generating interventions, as an intervention itself, and for building common strategic frameworks for movements.\n\nBy Levana Saxon","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/forum-theater\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Forum Theater\/TA_Forum Theater_Shakers.jpg","links":[104800,100207,100174,200268,200126,200271,300140,300246,200189,300261]},{"id":100218,"type":0,"title":"Electoral guerrilla theater","text":"Running for public office as a creative prank \u2014 not to win the election, but to get attention for a radical critique of policy or to sabotage the campaign of a particularly heinous candidate.

Days (or weeks) of action can be highly disciplined and structured, or they can be more like a potluck dinner, where everybody brings the dish s\/he feels like cooking up. Organizers might choose to invest time and energy in select \u201cflag-ship\u201d locations to help drive the story and take things to a higher level in a few spots.\nThe call to action. A call to action should resonate not just with your core supporters and networks, but should tell a story that the general public will understand, and motivate new volunteer leaders to take to the streets. Depending on the situation, a call to action might have an embedded demand of political leaders, or it can simply be an expression of grievances, like the call to #occupywallstreet.\nProviding the tools. Hard work, a compelling story, and a healthy dose of inspiration are the most important elements of a successful distributed action. But it can be helpful to provide some extra resources for those activists who have never organized an action before. This can be as simple as posting a web link to a few tips, or as complex as offering in-person trainings and downloadable toolkits with posters, checklists, sample press releases and more. Some kinds of actions, especially those that involve nonviolent direct action, will require more support than others see PRINCIPLE: Take risks, but take care.\n\nBy Phil Aroneanu","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/distributed-action\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Distributed Action\/TA_Distributed action_gisborne.jpg","links":[105009,104127,100193,100239,100195,100128,100230,200229,200269,200270,200135,200153,200244,200225,200223,200134,200180,200227,300228,300192,300179,300204,300209,300201,400164,400252,400144,400236,400210,404842,405098,405156,500389,100186,200260,200181,400157,400265,400197,400156]},{"id":100149,"type":0,"title":"Direct action","text":"To shut things down; to open things up; to pressure a target; to re-imagine what\u2019s possible; to intervene in a system; to empower people; to defend something good; to shine a spotlight on something bad. Direct action is at the heart of all human advancement. Sound like a grandiose claim? It is. But it\u2019s also beautifully simple: direct action means that we take collective action to change our circumstances, without handing our power to a middle person.\nWe see instances of direct action in indigenous parables and stories, in the Bible, Torah and Koran, in every people\u2019s movement and popular revolution in modern history. Direct action is often practiced by people who have few resources, seeking to liberate themselves from an injustice.\nPeople often conflate direct action with \u201cgetting arrested.\u201d While sometimes getting arrested can amplify your message, or is strategically necessary to achieve your goal, it isn\u2019t the point of direct action. (In most liberation struggles throughout history, \u201cgetting captured\u201d is actually seen as a bad thing!)\nSimilarly, people often conflate direct action with civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is a specific form of direct action that involves intentionally violating a law because that law is unjust \u2014 for instance, refusing to pay taxes that would fund a war, or refusing to comply with anti-immigrant legislation. In these circumstances, breaking the law is the purpose. With other kinds of direct action, laws may be broken, but the law being broken isn\u2019t the point. For example, we may be guilty of trespassing if we drop a banner from a building, but the violation is incidental: we aren\u2019t there to protest trespassing laws.\nWhile associated with confrontation, direct action at its core is about power. Smart direct action assesses power dynamics and finds a way to shift them.\nOne way of thinking about power is that there are two kinds: organized money and organized people. We don\u2019t have billions of dollars to buy politicians and governments, but with direct action organized people spend a different currency: we leverage risk. We leverage our freedom, our comfort, our privilege or our safety.\nAs Frederick Douglass said, \u201cpower concedes nothing without a demand.\u201d Malcolm X elaborated, \u201cPower never takes a step back, except in the face of more power.\u201d Rather than deferring to others to make changes for us through votes or lobbying, we seek to change the dynamics of power directly.\n\nBy Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/direct-action\/","links":[105009,100239,100191,100173,100146,100175,100240,100143,100245,100138,200227,200137,200153,200222,200238,200132,200219,200232,200255,200260,200129,200237,204970,300204,300259,300202,300169,300287,301240,400265,400145,400172,400185,400152,400236,400254,404749,500326,500285,500385,100128,100161,200225,200264,200130,200182,200131,300205,300203,300258,404842,400170,400210,400188,400194,400157,400251,400256,400213,400151,400167,400168]},{"id":100128,"type":0,"title":"Debt strike","text":"To fight back against financial exploitation when many people are crushed by debt. What does non-cooperation with our own oppression look like? Sometimes it looks like Rosa Parks refusing to sit in the back of the bus, and sometimes it\u2019s less visible \u2014 for instance, a coordinated refusal to make our monthly debt payments.\nWith wages in many countries stagnant since the 1970s, people have increasingly turned to debt financing to pay for education, housing and health care. Banks have aggressively pursued and profited from this explosion of debt, fueling economic inequality, inflating a massive credit bubble and trapping millions in a form of indentured servitude.\nMost people feel obliged to pay back loans no matter the cost, or fear the lasting consequences of default, but the financial crisis has begun to change that. After watching the government shovel trillions in bailouts and dirt-cheap loans to big banks, growing numbers view our debt burdens as a structural problem and a massive scam rather than a personal failure or a legitimate obligation. But asking politicians and banks for forgiveness is unlikely to get us anywhere, because our payments are their profits. What we need is leverage.\nEnter the debt strike, an experiment in collective bargaining for debtors. The idea is simple: en masse, we stop paying our bills to the banks until they negotiate. Because they can\u2019t operate without these payments \u2014 for student loans, mortgages, or consumer credit \u2014 they\u2019re under severe pressure to negotiate. Such a strike can be connected to demands to reform the financial system, abolish predatory and usurious loan conditions, or provide direct debt forgiveness. Strikers could even pool some or all of the money they\u2019re not paying, and put it into a \u201cstrike fund\u201d to support the campaign or kick-start alternative community-based credit systems.\nCoordination is key. We can\u2019t act in isolation, exposing ourselves to retaliation and division. Instead, participants should all sign a pledge \u2014 either public or confidential \u2014 to stop paying certain bills. When enough people sign up to provide real leverage, strike. In the meantime, organize furiously, publicize a running total, aggregate grievances, collect outrageous debt stories, and watch the financial \u00e9lite panic.\nA debt strike is audacious, simple, and easy to participate in \u2014 easier than paying bills, since all you have to do is not pay your bills. It takes courage and social support, but provides immediate gratification. Who doesn\u2019t despise the monthly ritual of sending away precious cash to line the pockets of dishonest and destructive financial institutions?\nAlthough a massive debt strike has not yet been organized, efforts are underway. People have been mobilizing for years to fight foreclosures and predatory loans. The Occupy Student Debt Campaign aims to gather a million student debt refusal pledges. Another group is building a social pledge system to connect debtors by neighborhood, common lenders and demands. Online social networks, pledge-to-act platforms like ThePoint.com and story aggregators like Tumblr may soon become weapons on the battlefield of debt.\nThe outrage, organizers, techniques and tools already exist, and the tactic has perhaps never been more justified. The debt strike is out there, waiting to take the world by storm.\n\n\nBy Sarah Jaffe and Matthew Skomarovsky","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/debt-strike\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Debt Strike\/TA_Debt strike_superhero.jpg","links":[100175,100148,100143,100149,200221,200137,200132,200212,200227,200232,200238,300259,300204,300214,300176,300262,300258]},{"id":100245,"type":0,"title":"Blockade","text":"To physically shut down something bad (a coal mine, the World Trade Organization), to protect something good (a forest, someone\u2019s home), or to make a symbolic statement, such as encircling a target (the White House).

What better way to air the dirty laundry of an irresponsible institution than to hang a giant banner over its front door? A banner drop can also be an effective way to frame or contextualize an upcoming event or protest see PRINCIPLE: Reframe. Banner hangs can also function as public service announcements to alert the public of an injustice or a dangerous situation.\nBanner hangs can be as low-tech and low-risk as several bedsheets tied to road overpasses decrying the Iraq War, but the ones that really pack a punch involve large pieces of cloth or netting deployed at great heights, often by experienced climbers.\nRegardless of the level of risk or complexity, all effective banner hangs start with a clear goal (you have a goal, right?!), and fall into two broad categories: communicative (concise protest statements), and concrete (blockade elements that directly disrupt business as usual) see PRINCIPLE: Make your actions both concrete and communicative. In 1991, in a great example of a banner hang with a concrete goal, small communities in the Pacific Northwest asked for help to stop nuclear warships from entering Clatsop County, Oregon, a designated nuclear-free zone on the Columbia River. An enormous net banner was deployed from the Astoria Bridge, affixed below the span where it would be difficult to remove, and weighted by the climbers\u2019 bodies themselves. The action succeeded in delaying the warships\u2019 entrance while educating the area on the issue.\nMost banner hangs, however, tend to be communicative. Take, for instance, the banner hung from a crane in downtown Seattle in November 1999 see CASE: Battle in Seattle just before the opening of the World Trade Organization meeting. The banner messaging was as clear as day: an iconic visual of a street sign with arrows pointing in opposite directions: democracy this way, WTO that way. This was a classic \u201cframing action.\u201d Hung on the eve of a big summit meeting and a huge protest, the banner made it clear what all the fuss to come was really about: a basic struggle of right and wrong; the People vs. WTO.\nWhen there is no crane, bridge or building to hang your banner from, large helium-filled weather balloons have been used to raise everything from CODEPINK\u2019s \u201cpink slip for President George Bush\u201d in front of the White House to a banner deployed from a houseboat on the East River in New York with a message for the UN.

Online petitions are an effective way of spreading information, raising an outcry or putting pressure on a target. But online actions alone are easily ignored by targets. To translate virtual signatures into real-world action, a number of netroots organizations have developed the art of creative petition delivery. While publicizing your message and the support it has garnered, creative petition deliveries put public pressure on your target.\nIt\u2019s helpful to find creative ways to physically quantify the number of petition signatures. A number of well-labeled boxes rolled into a target\u2019s office is a tried and true approach, but other tactics can be effective as well. For a petition asking the World Health Organization to investigate and regulate factory farms, the international multi-issue campaign organization Avaaz set up 200 cardboard pigs \u2014 each representing 1,000 petition signers \u2014 in front of the WHO building in Geneva, providing the media with a visual hook on which to peg stories about factory farms and swine flu.\nBut you don\u2019t have to physically occupy the same space as your target. Attracting media attention can be an effective way to reach a target as well. Avaaz sometimes places ads in newspapers that both their target and supporters are likely to read. In one instance, to deliver a petition against nuclear energy to German Chancellor Andrea Merkel, they purchased an ad in Der Spiegel, the German paper of record.\nOr try a more outlandish media stunt. To deliver a petition against deepwater oil drilling in the Arctic, Greenpeace International sent its executive director to a controversial oil rig in the middle of the ocean, where he trespassed onto the rig to deliver the petition to the ship\u2019s captain \u2014 at which point he was arrested and held for four days. Between the unusual way it was delivered and the media coverage that resulted, the petition was difficult for the target to ignore.\nSometimes less public tactics can be equally effective: to deliver a petition about cluster bombs to a UN conference debating arms munitions treaties, Avaaz first digitally delivered 600,000 petition signatures to the head of the conference, and then quietly distributed 1,000 fliers to conference attendees, describing the issue and listing the number of people who\u2019d signed the petition. Even the subtle hint of public pressure created a stir in the often obscure world of UN diplomats. The delivery had a big impact on the eventual outcome of the conference, which did not adopt a draft treaty to allow stockpiling of cluster bombs.\nCreative petition deliveries allow organizers to turn online outcry into offline action. By becoming unavoidably visible to a campaign target, creative deliveries make sure the voices of thousands of petition signers are publicly heard.\n\nBy Duncan Meisel","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/creative-petition-delivery\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/TACTIC Creative Pertition Devliery\/TA_Crative Petition Delivery_Stretcher.jpg","links":[100171,100148,100230,100198,200130,200183,200180,200137,200238,200233,200154,300287,300204,300208,500040,200211]},{"id":100161,"type":0,"title":"Creative disruption","text":"To expose and disrupt the public relations efforts of the armed and dangerous.

If a war criminal like Dick Cheney or a corporate criminal like former BP CEO Tony Hayward comes to town, what\u2019s the best way to challenge the spin they\u2019ll put on their misdeeds? Often, the scale of the misdeeds and the imbalance of power are so great that activists will forgo dialogue and move straight to disruption, attempting to shut down or seriously disrupt the event. Disruption can be an effective tactic, and has been used successfully by small groups of people, often with little advance notice or advance planning.\nThe problem, of course, is that\u00a0not only does the target control the mic, the stage, and the venue, but even more importantly, as an invited guest or the official speaker, s\/he has the audience\u2019s sympathy. A poorly thought-out shout-down or disruption can easily backfire. The target can portray themselves as a victim of anti-free speech harassment, thus gaining public sympathy and a larger platform. The challenge is to disrupt the event without handing your target that opportunity.\nSometimes an oblique intervention that re-frames the target\u2019s remarks or forces a response to your issues without literally preventing anyone from speaking can be more effective than just shouting down someone. When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a rare town hall meeting in San Francisco in 2006 during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, CODEPINK demonstrators \u2014 angry that Pelosi was not pushing for a cut-off in war funding \u2014 waited until the Q and A session, then surrounded the stage with their \u201cStop Funding War\u201d banners and stood there, silently, for the remainder of the meeting.\nThe creative use of a sign or banner can help you avoid the \u201cit\u2019s an attack on free speech\u201d trap. In effect, you\u2019re adding an additional \u201clayer\u201d of speech; you\u2019re engaging in more free speech, not less. Song can also be used in this way. A 2011 foreclosure auction in Brooklyn, for instance, was movingly disrupted\u00a0by protesters breaking into song. Song creates sympathy.\nA creative disruption needn\u2019t be passive. When Newt Gingrich came to the Minnesota Family Council conference for a book signing, a queer activist dutifully waited in line and when it came to his turn, dumped rainbow glitter over Gingrich, shouting, \u201cFeel the rainbow, Newt! Stop the hate, stop anti-gay policies\u201d as he was escorted out of the room. The video documenting the event see PRINCIPLE: Do the media\u2019s work for them went viral and the disruption gained international press attention, sparking a wave of LGBT activism. The tactic of \u201cglitter-bombing\u201d even made it into an episode of the TV show Glee.\nTheater is another way to \u201cdisrupt without disrupting.\u201d When Jeane Kirkpatrick (Reagan\u2019s Ambassador to the UN) came to UC Berkeley in the 1980\u2019s, activists staged a mock death-squad kidnapping. \u201cSoldiers\u201d (students) in irregular fatigues marched down the main aisle barking orders in Spanish and dragged off a few students kicking and screaming from the audience. Others then scattered leaflets detailing the U.S.\u2019s and Kirkpatrick\u2019s support for El Salvador\u2019s death-squad government from the balcony onto the stunned audience.\nAs these examples show, it\u2019s critical to tailor your disruption to the specific target and situation. Often, you can be more effective if you step out of the \u201ccombative speech box\u201d and consider alternate modalities, like visuals, song, theater, and humor.\n\n\nBy Nancy L.

The word vigil comes from the Latin word for wakefulness, and refers to a practice of keeping watch through the night over the dead or dying. Compared to the blustery pronouncements of a rally, a candlelight vigil offers a more soulful and symbolically potent expression of dissent.\nUnfortunately, routine and self-righteousness can strip vigils of their power. In the American peace movement of the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201990s, the \u201ccandlelight vigil\u201d \u2014 all too often a handful of dour people silently holding candles \u2014 became a standard, and fatally predictable, form of protest.\nAn artistic vigil, on the other hand, brings a more artful touch. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean costumes and face paint and puppets (though it could). It means thoughtful symbolism, the right tone and a distinct look and feel that clearly convey the meaning of the vigil. An artistic vigil often draws upon ritual elements see PRINCIPLE: Use the power of ritual to both deepen the experience of participants and demonstrate that experience to observers.\nA good example is the series of \u201cOur Grief Is Not a Cry for War\u201d vigils organized by the Artists\u2019 Network of Refuse &amp; Resist in New York City in the wake of 9\/11. People were asked to wear a dust mask (common in NYC after 9\/11), dress all in black (common in NYC all the time), show up at Times Square at exactly 5 pm, and remain absolutely silent. Each participant held a sign that read \u201cOur Grief Is Not a Cry for War.\u201d These vigils were silent and solemn, but there was a precision to the message that gave them a visceral potency in that emotionally raw time, for participants and observers alike.\nThe most famous vigils of the late twentieth century were probably those organized by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group of Argentinian women whose children were disappeared by Argentina\u2019s 70s-era military dictatorship. By gathering every Thursday for more than a decade in the plaza in front of the Presidential Palace, they not only kept vigil for their lost loved ones, but also kept pressure on the government to answer for its crimes.\nThe \u201cartistry\u201d of a vigil can be exceedingly complex, or as simple as a few basic rituals. The simple fact of women wearing black and gathering in silence on Fridays gives shape and presence to the Women in Black worldwide network of vigils. Begun by Israeli women during the First Intifada to protest the occupation of Palestine, it has since expanded across the globe and embraced broader anti-war and pro-justice themes, but nonetheless maintains its distinctive character. At the other end of the spectrum, artist Suzanne Lacy has created complex works of art in which victims of sexual violence stand vigil amidst the art installations that tell their stories.\n\n\nBy Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/artistic-vigil\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/artistic-vigil-AIDS-day-dec2005.jpg","links":[104127,100171,100195,100148,100186,100174,100198,200231,200189,200130,200229,200180,200158,200181,300287,300208,300202,300263,500302,500395,500364,500354,500304,500344,200223,200220,200211]},{"id":100198,"type":0,"title":"Advanced leafleting","text":"To get important information into the right hands.

Yes, an actual leafleting robot. In 1998, the Institute for Applied Autonomy built \u201cLittle Brother,\u201d a small, intentionally cute, 1950s-style metal robot to be a pamphleteer. In their tests, strangers avoided a human pamphleteer, but would go out of their way to take literature from the robot.\nMake it fun. Make it unusual. Make it memorable. Don\u2019t just hand out leaflets. Climb up on some guy\u2019s shoulders and hand out leaflets from there, as one of the authors of this piece did as a student organizer. (He also tried the same tactic hitchhiking, with less stellar results.) The shareholder heading into a meeting is more likely to take, read and remember the custom message inside the fortune cookie you just handed her than a rectangle of paper packed with text.\nUsing theater and costumes to leaflet can also be effective. In the 1980s, activists opposed to U.S. military intervention in Central America dressed up as waiters and carried maps of Central America on serving trays, with little green plastic toy soldiers glued to the map. They would go up to people in the street and say, \u201cExcuse me, sir, did you order this war?\u201d When the \u201cno\u201d response invariably followed, they would present an itemized bill outlining the costs: \u201cWell, you paid for it!\u201d Even if the person they addressed didn\u2019t take the leaflet, they\u2019d get the message.\nThe point is, leafleting is not a bad tactic. It\u2019s still a good way to tell passersby what you\u2019re marching for, why you\u2019re making so much noise on a street corner or why you\u2019re setting police cars on fire. But people are more likely to take your leaflet, read it, and remember what it\u2019s all about if you deliver it with flair. Or ice cream.\n\n\nBy Steve Lambert and Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/tactic\/advanced-leafleting\/","links":[100186,100230,100161,100138,100218,200130,200180,200158,200244,200211,404526,500306,500393,200264,200183]},{"id":204970,"type":1,"title":"Jury-rig solutions (or, How would MacGyver protest?)","text":"Fix a problem as best you can to pressure authorities to fix it properly. Imagine a problem that you, as a regular citizen, can\u2019t solve alone. For example, let\u2019s say your street is paved with cheap, bad materials after your city privatized road repair, and now has lots of potholes. You could complain about it, you could create a petition to pressure local authorities and the company, or you could idly wait for somebody to take action. In any of these cases, you would still have to risk damage to your car or bicycle until the company steps up or the city steps in.\nBut what if you choose to fix it yourself? There is, of course, no comparison between what you and your friends can do with a limited amount of time, money, and expertise, and what a professional fix would look like. But if you fill the potholes temporarily with cement, traffic would immediately move better and you, as a creative activist, could use the action to gather support and build pressure against the privatization of public services.\nCall it a jury-rigging protest: temporarily solving a problem with quick, small, concrete actions that can build support for bigger and better solutions. You could put a sign in each covered pothole saying \u201ccitizens, not politicians, fixed this mess.\u201d It\u2019ll hopefully embarrass the city\u2019s administration, which will be compelled to live up to its responsibility to provide public services.\nThe Black Panther Party made excellent use of this tactic. Sick of waiting for the City of Oakland to build a traffic light at a busy intersection near a school where several children had been killed or injured by vehicles, the Panthers set up an armed crossing guard to escort children across the intersection. No further deaths or injuries were reported until the traffic light was finally installed \u2014 more than a year ahead of schedule.\nAs another example, the Rolling Jubilee campaign, which saw activists raise money to buy off Americans\u2019 bad debts for pennies on the dollar, and then forgive that debt, was never conceived to be the silver bullet for people\u2019s debt problems. While it does indeed help those who are facing bankruptcy, of equal importance is the message it sends about the arbitrary and unfair nature of the entire bank system. This was a jury-rig that underscored just how broken the entire banking system is, and how easy and beneficial it would be to simply erase that crippling debt.\nSimilarly, when a city has no recycling policies, citizens can\u2019t create selective garbage collection by themselves, but they can bring visibility and respect to the informal workers that made their living by jury-rigged a solution (see CASE: Pimp my&#8230; carroca!). Society can celebrate them as heroes, improve their work conditions and galvanize support for universal and selective trash collection.\nOr take the Max Feffer tunnel, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, whose walls were totally covered by grime from engine exhaust. Alexandre Orion chose to selectively clean some parts of it through reverse graffiti \u2014 erasing some of the soot to expose the wall beneath, rather than drawing over it. No police officer could ever arrest him for cleaning a public space, so local authorities had no choice but to clean the walls, which is what Orion wanted in the first place!\nWhen a citizen is able to fix something completely, but opts to only jury-rig it, that\u2019s bad. But a jury-rigged solution can be used as a provocative first step towards bolder and more lasting solutions (see PRINCIPLE: Escalate strategically). It requires nothing more than creativity and a willingness to get your hands dirty to come up with an unconventional and funny solution that will attract attention to your cause.\n\nBy Gui Bueno","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/jury-rig-solutions\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/PR_Jury-rig-solution_Alexandre_Orion_Oss_rio_2006.jpg","links":[100184,100149,200132,200227,200131,200238,200130,200223,300287,300205,404749,400254,400236,400185]},{"id":201558,"type":1,"title":"Recapture the flag","text":"Love your country, and fight so that its flag and other national symbols evoke its most egalitarian and noble values. Samuel Johnson did not mean patriotism per se when he famously called patriotism the last refuge of a scoundrel. He meant false patriotism. The uncritical, unthinking, \u201cLove it or leave it\u201d variety of patriotism. Unfortunately, because this kind of patriotism is louder, angrier, more shameless, and often used deliberately to squash dissent and debate, it often becomes the only recognized form of patriotism.\nProgressives, who tend to have a more nuanced, \u201cLove it and fix it\u201d kind of patriotism, often have a harder time finding their full-throated patriotic voice. And, indeed, there are some excellent reasons to be ambivalent about wielding the symbols of our nation. One is the fact that slavery, genocide, war, and other horrors have been carried out in the name of, and with the symbols of, most nations with a colonial history, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and most of western Europe. Another is the conviction that progressives\u2019 greatest strength is a solidarity narrative based on shared class interest and a common humanity that transcends the boundaries of nation states.\nYet we can\u2019t deny that the idea and symbols of one\u2019s nation move many people deeply and provide a meaningful feeling of social solidarity. If we are to be effective as change agents, we need to engage, claim, and contest the meanings of these symbols. To shun the flag out of an understandable distaste for nationalism is to let our opponents monopolize it. It allows them to use these powerful symbols uncontested. It lets them shape the collective story for their purposes.\nThe meaning of a given symbol like the flag is not a fixed thing (see THEORY: Floating signifier). Immigrants and their allies who wave the American flag at immigration reform rallies are claiming their rightful share to its meaning. They seek to imbue the flag with meanings of inclusivity and social justice while their opponents wield the symbol for exclusionary, oppressive, xenophobic purposes. Yes, progressives can raise all sorts of factually true points about how the United States is not and has never been a very welcoming nation. And if you\u2019re a history teacher, that\u2019s at least part of what you should tell your students. But if you\u2019re trying to build a mass movement for change, then you need to tell stories that invite people to step into their best selves, as well as their most beloved aspirations for their country.\nWe must, in other words, recapture the flag. We need to dig into our nation\u2019s history to discover \u201callies\u201d \u2014 the people, principles, and stories that speak to our goals of a better world. Without claiming these stories as part of our history, we are left to engage in head-on attacks against the national institutions we want to change.\nRecapturing the flag allows us to challenge the worst parts of nationalism, while also infusing our struggles with a broad appeal to the common values and symbols that move us most.\n\nBy Jonathan Matthew Smucker and Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/recapture-flag\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/PR_Recapture-the-flag_marching-under-a-flag.jpg","links":[100184,100177,200180,200211,200231,200220,200255,200199,200182,200241,200181,300192,300243,300178,300228,300540,300263,400194,400157,400188,500379,500348,500342,400168]},{"id":200526,"type":1,"title":"The real action is your target&#8217;s reaction","text":"When taking on a big and well-known target, it is often the target\u2019s reaction to your action that\u2019s the key to success. Therefore, anticipate your target's reactions and write them into your script. During the Salt March of 1930, Indian independence activists famously kept walking, unarmed and undeterred, into the brutal blows of British police (see CASE: The Salt March). Importantly, the press were there \u2014 activists made sure of it \u2014 to document the colonial government playing the villain in predictably despicable fashion. The Indian nation rallied to the cause. World public opinion followed.\nOrganizer Saul Alinsky later coined the term \u201cpolitical jiu-jitsu\u201d to describe actions like this. Confrontations like the Salt March enable under-resourced activist groups to use a powerful opponent\u2019s momentum against them by provoking a reaction, and then watching them fall flat, literally or figuratively, in front of the cameras.\nWhen applying this principle, it\u2019s important to understand that you can\u2019t just hope the target reacts in a way that spotlights the injustice. Wherever possible, plan for your target\u2019s reactions, encourage them, and incorporate them into the action. If it doesn\u2019t work the first time, adjust and try again.\nA good way to ensure you get a strategically useful reaction from your target is to force them into a \u201cDecision Dilemma\u201d (see PRINCIPLE: Put your target in a decision dilemma), where all of their available options play to your advantage. When the Yes Men, impersonating a spokesperson for Dow Chemical, announced on BBC TV that Dow was apologizing for the Bhopal disaster and allocating $12 billion to compensate the victims (see CASE: Dow Chemical apologizes for Bhopal), Dow\u2019s stock plummeted and they were forced to react. Dow had to issue a statement saying they were NOT apologizing for the Bhopal disaster and would NOT be compensating the victims. And that was the big tell. Here, once again, the action (happily and by design) was dwarfed by the target\u2019s reaction.\nAs the Dow Chemical case illustrates, you don\u2019t need a physical confrontation to make good theater. In 2000, the Bush campaign sued activist Zack Exley and tried to shut down his prank website, GWBush.com (a domain Exley had managed to buy before the campaign had). The press picked up the story, and with each new legal attack (Bush at one point saying \u201cthere ought to be limits to freedom\u201d), there was another wave of press sympathetic to the site and combative towards a hapless dolt who somehow ended up being President for eight years. (A sorry reminder that even the cleverest one-off tactic does not a successful campaign make.)\nContrary to popular belief, when one of the big boys threatens you (and if you use a company\u2019s trademark in an action, for example, you can count on a cease and desist letter), you should celebrate! You are the David to their Goliath, and now you have the upper hand! Take their best quotes, weave them into a press release, and voila, you\u2019ve cast them in your play. In the timeless logic of jiu-jitsu, you have borrowed some of their power, and if coverage goes your way, you have used their offensive momentum to flip them on their backs.

From 2009 to the present, countries from the UK to Chile have seen an upsurge of student strikes and school occupations to protest raising tuition fees. The 2011 Spanish indignados uprising began under the slogan \u201cwe are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers.\u201d A few months later, encampment protests began in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rothschild Boulevard demanding public housing. Student debt and housing debt are central themes in the Occupy movement, which from a few tents in New York City spread worldwide.\nThese movements were able to build popular support because they focused on specific conditions. Many people are unable to afford education, health care, housing and child care. These conditions all reflect the growing debt burden that many carry. Essential goods like housing, education and health care have relatively inelastic demand, which means the limit to their price is basically everything you have plus everything you can borrow. Meanwhile, consumer spending, the engine of the economy, is increasingly fuelled not by rising wages, but by cheap credit, resulting in greater and greater levels of consumer debt. Today the issue of debt unites millions in a common struggle.\nBuilding a mass movement around debt, like building any mass movement, is a consciousness-raising process. For the people to be united in a movement, they must possess a consciousness of their common interests and their common enemies. There must be a consciousness of class, and a willingness to understand that the only way to change class conditions is to unite and fight. Major social changes occur when people unite around a common cause.\nDebt is at the core of the market system itself, and the solution is not better terms alone, but alternatives to that system. Instead of the conservative motto \u201cfair financial terms from honest bankers,\u201d we must paint our banners with the words \u201cAbolition of the debt system.\u201d Debtors of the world, unite!\nNew forms of struggle require new forms of organization to directly fight for changes. Debtors\u2019 unions are one such form: organizing debtors to collectively bargain for favorable terms for existing debtors. Just as labor unions bargain for improved wages and working conditions through the threat of refusal to work, debtors unions could use organized refusals to pay debts to bargain.\nDrawing on mass support from millions of people struggling to pay their bills, we can build a movement that aspires to far more than small reforms to banking and bankruptcy rules, but that challenges the entire capitalist system and its drive to profit from imposing scarcity on essential goods like education, housing, child care and health care. As we find our way across this new terrain, we must keep our eyes on the big prize: not better terms alone, but alternatives to the market system.\n\nBy Dmytri Kleiner","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/debtors-of-the-world-unite\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Debtors of the World Unite\/PR_Debtors of the World Unite_San Precario.jpg","links":[100175,100128,200137,200232,200237,300262,300176,300214,404842,300258]},{"id":200222,"type":1,"title":"Maintain nonviolent discipline","text":"Nonviolent action works best when you stay nonviolent. It\u2019s amazing to think that unarmed masses of people have defeated armed-to-the-teeth forces using humble techniques as strikes, occupations, boycotts and sit-ins. One way of understanding why this can happen is that nonviolent methods put the oppressor in a decision dilemma: either rain pain on a bunch of unarmed resisters, or capitulate. The former can turn public opinion toward the protesters and undermine the legitimacy upon which the oppressor\u2019s power rests. If the resistance persists, escalating crackdowns can start to backfire, even to the point that the police or military refuse to participate. Eventually the sovereign has no choice but to capitulate.\nThis basic logic frays, however, as soon as the resisters start meeting violence with violence. If the opponent succeeds in portraying resisters as a threat to peace and order, it escapes the decision dilemma, reasserting its legitimacy by playing the part of protector, of securer, of stabilizer. Unless you can scrounge up enough guns to match the military\u2019s firepower, your movement is toast.\nPolitical scientist Erica Chenoweth and sociologist Kurt Schock examined the data of past resistance movements and found that having an armed flank dramatically reduces the ability of an uprising to attract widespread participation. Most people aren\u2019t interested in getting martyred in a firefight, so they\u2019ll stay home. Rather than merely representing one wing of a \u201cdiversity of tactics,\u201d therefore, undisciplined violence in a movement tends to lessen the effectiveness of nonviolent mass movements see TACTIC: Strategic nonviolence. That\u2019s why oppressors love to insert provocateurs into resistance movements to push them into violence and then discredit them.\nMany people keep nonviolent discipline for mainly strategic reasons: they do it because it\u2019s effective, rather than as a matter of principle. In practice, though, maintaining nonviolent discipline in the face of provocation can be difficult if you don\u2019t consider it at least partly as an end in itself.

Counter by promoting accountability within the group. Have you ever sat through an interminable meeting where everyone is theoretically on equal grounding, and yet only one or two people are doing eighty percent of the talking? Where there\u2019s no facilitator, for fear of introducing hierarchy, and so the discussion goes in endless circles, never quite sure when it\u2019s finished? Where new members lose patience because their suggestions are ignored and their ideas left to float in the ether?\nWelcome to the tyranny of structurelessness.\nJo Freeman\u2019s seminal 1970 essay \u201cThe Tyranny of Structurelessness\u201d put a name to the persistent problem that plagues decision makers in non-hierarchical groupings, organizations or collectives.[1] Freeman argued that by claiming to eschew hierarchy, or even leadership, activists are really unilaterally disarming themselves when it comes to identifying and correcting impediments to effective collective action. As she points out, \u201cthere is no such thing as a structureless group.\u201d\nThis means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, as to aim at an \u201cobjective\u201d news story, \u201cvalue-free\u201d social science, or a \u201cfree\u201d economy. A \u201claissez-faire\u201d group is about as realistic as a \u201claissez faire\u201d society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others\u2026 Thus structurelessness becomes a way of masking power.\nIt would be bad enough if structurelessness merely led to bruised feelings and longer meetings, but there is a further problem: it simply doesn\u2019t work for long. If you\u2019re engaging in any kind of long-term campaign, a lack of accountability and organized incorporation of feedback will often prove fatal.\nSo what\u2019s the way out of a structureless organization that is not working properly? The best cure is prevention: establish clear processes from the start. But if you\u2019re stuck in such an arrangement, and wish to change the culture to something more democratic and participatory, the key concept to introduce and press for isn\u2019t hierarchy per se, but accountability.\nAccountability is what gives democracy its bite, distinguishing it from a rote exercise in communicating preferences. It involves the establishment of real consequences when the expressed will of the people is not implemented as promised. (By contrast, structurelessness provides plenty of ways to note collective preferences, but precious few equitable or effective ways to ensure they\u2019re acted upon.) Hierarchy is a particular vision of how accountability is carried out, but for the hierarchy-adverse it\u2019s by no means the only one.\nThere are as many organizational structures as there are philosophies of collective action. But they virtually all share one thing in common: for better or worse, they acknowledge their own structure, instead of hiding behind unlikely and obfuscating assertions of structurelessness. That acknowledgment, and the accountability it fosters, is the only way to ensure effective and equitable decision-making.\n\n\n\t[1] Structurelessness is often mistakenly conflated with absence of hierarchy, when in fact, effective non-hierarchical forms of organizing actually require a great deal of structure. Anyone who has participated in an effectively facilitated general assembly or spokescouncil meeting will well understand this distinction.\n &#x21A9;\nBy Josh Bolotsky","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/beware-the-tyranny-of-structurelessness\/","links":[200136,200232,200133,200269,200135,200260,200270,200224]},{"id":200260,"type":1,"title":"We are all leaders","text":"An otherwise healthy distrust of hierarchy can lead to a negative attitude toward all forms of leadership.

At first glance these two phrases may seem like two ways of saying the same thing, which is essentially, \u201cWe believe in organizing in a way that is more horizontal than vertical. We believe in equalizing participation and resisting social hierarchies.\u201d But the word leadership can mean a lot of things, and not all involve the creation of hierarchies. Taking leadership can mean taking initiative on moving a project or task forward, or taking responsibility for recognizing what is needed, and stepping up individually or collectively to do that thing.\nIt is important, in other words, to distinguish between horizontal organization and disorganization, and to foster models of dispersed leadership that promote responsibility, accountability and effectiveness.\nThis is not just a matter of semantics.

Slide the window of acceptable debate by focusing attention on a position that is more radical than your own. The various policy options available on a given issue can be roughly plotted on a spectrum of public acceptability, from unthinkable, to fringe, to acceptable, to common sense, to policy. The Overton window, named after Joseph Overton, a staffer for the center-right Mackinac Center for Public Policy, designates the range of points on the spectrum that are considered part of a \u201csensible\u201d conversation within public opinion and\/or traditional mass media.\nThe most important thing about the Overton window, however, is that it can be shifted to the left or the right, with the once merely \u201cacceptable\u201d becoming \u201cpopular\u201d or even imminent policy, and formerly \u201cunthinkable\u201d positions becoming the open position of a partisan base. The challenge for activists and advocates is to move the window in the direction of their preferred outcomes, so their desired outcome moves closer and closer to \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\nThere are two ways to do this: the long, hard way and the short, easy way. The long, hard way is to continue making your actual case persistently and persuasively until your position becomes more politically mainstream, whether it be due to the strength of your rhetoric or a long-term shift in societal values. By contrast, the short, easy way is to amplify and echo the voices of those who take a position a few notches more radical than what you really want.\nFor example, if what you actually want is a public health care option in the United States, coordinate with and promote those pushing for single-payer, universal health care. If the single-payer approach constitutes the \u201cacceptable left\u201d flank of the discourse, then the public option looks, by comparison, like the conservative option it was once considered back when it was first proposed by Orrin Hatch in 1994.\nThis is Negotiating 101. Unfortunately, the right has been far ahead of the left in moving the Overton window in their desired direction for a long time. If anything, the left often plays it in the exact wrong way, actively policing and seeking to silence its radicals for fear that strong left positions will serve to discredit moderate left positions. The irony is that the Overton window should actually be easier for progressives to play: if you look at the polling on issue after issue, from education to jobs to foreign policy, the actual majority stances tend to be to the left of the range of policy proposals on offer.\n\nBy Josh Bolotsky","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/use-your-radical-fringe-to-shift-the-overton-window\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Use Your Radical Fringe\/PR_Use Your Radical Fringe_Jimmy McMillan.jpg","links":[100239,100218,100128,200132,200182,200237,400162,400213,400266,400145,500775,500040,500285,500352,500391,300142,300178,300205,400210,400188,400251]},{"id":200181,"type":1,"title":"Use the power of ritual","text":"Rituals like weddings, funerals, baptisms, exorcisms and vigils are powerful experiences for participants. By adapting sacred and symbolic elements you can use the power of ritual to give your actions greater depth and power. Rituals can connect us to the deepest truths of why politics matters. As anyone who has participated in a candlelight vigil will know, sometimes the act of quietly bearing witness to an injustice can carry more moral force than railing against it. A ritual can also give an otherwise mundane political gathering a stronger storyline, such as the 2011 protest of mortgage fraud at Chase Bank in New York City, where hundreds of members of faith communities and several ministers performed an exorcism on a bank \u201cpossessed by the demons of selfishness and avarice.\u201d\nThe ritual you choose need not be elaborate for it to have a powerful impact. You can imbue your political street theater with some of the power of ritual just by borrowing its rhythms. Imagine two characters on the street: a military general and a politician, slowly tossing a huge sack of money back and forth across a wide expanse. In between, a regular Joe, sitting forlornly, watches the sack sail back and forth. Nearby, a spokesperson hands out a fact sheet that tells the rest of the story. Often this kind of nonverbal, ritual-like performance, which repeats a simple but visually arresting motion, can be more powerful and effective than a full-length skit crammed with facts and figures.\nGhost Bike shrines \u2014 old bikes whitewashed and decked with flowers stationed as memorials at urban crossroads where cyclists have been killed \u2014 are a haunting presence, protest sculpture and fitting memorial all rolled into one.\nBecause they are such well-worn forms, rituals are ripe for mockery and comic adaptation, whether it\u2019s the Billionaires for Bush doing a vigil for corporate welfare, or Reverend Billy brandishing a stuffed Mickey Mouse on a cross while doing an exorcism inside the Times Square Disney Store. In 1967, antiwar prankster Abbie Hoffman led 20,000 protesters in an attempt to levitate the Pentagon \u2014 the National Guard was under strict orders to never allow an unbroken chain of hands around the building.\nOur familiarity with ritual makes it a great format for self-organizing. A ritual provides a natural script and symbolism. Even complete strangers naturally fall into a rhythm around it. This is even true for recently invented rituals such as monthly Critical Mass bike rides or the yearly ritual of Buy Nothing Day. In more repressive environments, the sacredness of a ritual offers protection, or at least courage. Think of Catholic Mass in Stalinist Poland or death squad-era El Salvador. In the Iranian Revolution (of 1979, as well as the revolts in 2010), the funerals of martyrs killed at the last protest fueled the next round of protests in an accelerating cycle.\nAt its best, a ritual is a cathartic, transformative experience. At a bat mitzvah, a child crosses over into adulthood. At a funeral, mourners grieve and find closure. A ritual harnessed to a political purpose should have an equally powerful effect, whether it is recommitting to a cause, finding courage, voicing dissent, or building trust.\n\nBy Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/use-the-power-of-ritual\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Use the Power of Ritual\/PR_Use the power of ritual_peace vigil.jpg","links":[105009,100171,100230,201558,100174,100148,200231,200130,200131,200180,200158,200190,200129,300287,300208,300243,300192,300205,400157,400265,405156,500360,500395,500364,500354,500302,500342,500377,500344,200229,200211,300206,400170,400256,400213,400168]},{"id":200248,"type":1,"title":"Use the law, don&#8217;t be afraid of it","text":"Talk to more than one lawyer and pick the one whose advice you want to follow. The law is a funny thing. Sometimes the Yes Men ask lawyers before we do anything particularly dangerous. We get one of two answers: \u201cDon\u2019t do it! It\u2019s illegal. You\u2019ll get sued!\u201d or \u201cAwesome! It\u2019s probably legal, and besides, you\u2019re righteous in the court of public opinion.\u201d The \u201cawesomes,\u201d are almost always right for two reasons: 1) In the U.S. at least, the law does in fact protect freedom of speech to a very high degree (not always a good thing: corporate lobbying is also considered free speech), and 2) corporations don\u2019t sue you because they know how it can blow back on them and they want to avoid having yet more egg on their big, blank, mechanical faces. In the Yes Men\u2019s twelve years of activism, we\u2019ve only been sued once.\nCorporations won\u2019t sue you, but they may send you a cease-and-desist letter. Rather than a cause to worry, this can be a great boon. C&amp;D letters are letters from lawyers that threaten you with a lawsuit, usually in highfalutin\u2019 legal language. They carry absolutely no legal weight and can be ignored \u2014 though of course you then take the risk that the lawyers will follow through. Almost always, however, the C&amp;D letter, while not exactly a bluff, is a formality. For example, companies have trademarks, and in order to keep them they have to demonstrate that they\u2019re making efforts to defend them \u2014 and a C&amp;D letter qualifies as evidence of such an effort.\nIf you receive a C&amp;D letter, it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to stretch out the story and get an additional wave of news coverage for your action. First thing we do when we receive a C&amp;D letter is reach out to a lawyer we trust and see what she thinks \u2014 though we\u2019re always prepared to ignore her advice. Then, we consider whether there\u2019s anything funny we can do with the letter. For example, after we put up the coalcares.org site, we received a C&amp;D letter from Peabody Energy, America\u2019s largest coal producer. Instead of taking down the site, we responded in a way that enlarged the issue. It\u2019s not just Peabody that\u2019s giving kids asthma, we noted, but all American coal companies. So we removed Peabody\u2019s name from the site and added the names of all the other coal companies. We subsequently received three more C&amp;D letters, which we also ignored.\nLawyers are not to be feared, though the same can\u2019t always be said for the law. If you are, for example, pretending to be Exxon-Mobil at a petroleum conference, there is no need to break character when the conference\u2019s private security lock you in a small room and cross-examine you (trust us on this one). But when the real police arrive, you may as well tell them honestly what you are up to. They may even turn out to be on your side, especially if you seem reasonable in contrast to the exasperated conference organizer or private security goon. In general, you should avoid lying to the police unless you have a really really good reason.\nRemember: Don\u2019t be afraid of suits, law- or otherwise.\nHOW THE OPPOSITE IS EQUALLY TRUE: Sometimes corporations do sue activists, especially those with limited resources to defend themselves. That\u2019s called a SLAPP (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation) suit. However, usually, all you really need to do to avoid any such corporate shenanigans is be ready to widely publicize the brouhaha, and hurl the aforementioned egg smack dab onto the corporate forehead.\n\nBy Andy Bichlbaum","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/use-the-law-dont-be-afraid-of-it\/","links":[104127,100146,100234,100218,100127,100184,200227,200526,200242,200238,300287,300208,300204,400266,404526,500775,200225,200132,200190,300203,400188,400157,400252,400152]},{"id":200225,"type":1,"title":"Use the Jedi mind trick","text":"The Jedi mind trick worked for Obi-Wan Kenobi, and it can work for you, too. You just have to believe in yourself, and others will, too. Aside from being able to move objects with your mind and having a retractable sword made out of freaking light (how cool is that??), the best thing about being a Jedi has got to be the mind trick. The ability to persuade with a calm voice and a finger wave, \u201cThese aren\u2019t the droids you\u2019re looking for,\u201d could prove indispensable in any number of beautiful trouble-making situations.\nGood news: this hypnotic power of persuasion is actually within your reach.

Though this may not work on your bill collector (\u201cI\u2019m not the deadbeat you\u2019re looking for\u201d), it may work in convincing the mainstream media to cover your event or the police to leave you alone. You might even pass unchallenged through the front gate of a nuclear power plant, or take charge of a closed-door meeting to which you weren\u2019t invited. With the right attitude, much more becomes possible than you might have thought.\nWith nothing more than confidence, an activist adept at the Jedi mind trick can make a security guard look the other way, or convince thousands of people, including a BBC news anchor, that he is a Dow Chemical Company spokesperson, or that it\u2019s perfectly normal to wear a climbing helmet in the middle of a convention center and start climbing the scaffolding.\nHere are a couple of things to keep in mind as you prepare to break out the Jedi mind trick on an unsuspecting low-level functionary:\nKnow the rules, suspend the rules. The ability to transgress, trespass, or otherwise do what you shouldn\u2019t with complete self-assurance, especially if challenged, carries its own power.\nAct like you belong (a.k.a. fake it \u2018till you get kicked out).

One cute young woman posing as a lost tourist was all it took to distract the guard and provide enough time for the truck to position itself, dump its load and drive off.\nAgeism\nNeed to get information through enemy lines? During the First Intifada or uprising in Palestine, 1987\u20131993, Israel tried to quash the non-violent resistance in many ways, including cutting communication and limiting travel between Palestinian cities. In order to get the word out to coordinate strikes, boycotts, and other actions, youth were enlisted to carry memorized information between cities. The Israeli soldiers let the kids through, never imagining they were doing the real work of connecting the resistance.\nRacism\nNeed to put more pressure on a target from unexpected directions? Saul Alinsky relates a classic example of using racism to win in Chicago in the 1950s: In a campaign to improve slum conditions in an organized black ghetto, organizers took the fight beyond their neighborhoods into the lily-white suburb where the slumlord lived. The presence of black men and women picketing outside his house led to a flood of phone calls from the neighbors who didn\u2019t care at all about the slums and would not have gotten involved otherwise, but wanted to keep their own neighborhood segregated, and so pressured the slumlord into capitulating.[1]\nClassism\nNeed to find your way into a corporate office or exclusive event? Many a time the most radical, hairy and scruffily adorned activists have shaved, ironed and primped their way into a situation that would have been off limits to those in scrappy activist garb.

When they refuse, the injustice of the situation is laid bare for all to see. She has \u201cturned the tables.\u201d\nPeople have an innate sense of fairness, but don\u2019t always see the injustices happening around them. By taking an existing unjust situation and dramatically flipping it back upon its source, you can highlight the inherent asymmetry and activate people\u2019s sense of fairness. Turning the tables like this can be an effective means of garnering public support as well as undercutting the moral authority of your target.\nConsider the turning streets into gardens action see CASE. New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was attempting to sell off community gardens to developers, an action that would have displaced community groups and left the city with fewer places for children to play. Community members were rightly outraged, though initially they had a hard time gaining public support. To turn the tables, the activists took over a city block in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side and turned it into a vibrant civic space for conversation, education, and celebration. Their message was \u201cOkay, if you can kick us out of our gardens, then we can kick you off your streets.\u201d\nGreenpeace has consistently made use of this tactic to shed light on toxic dumping. In 2003 they partnered with families and victims of the massive chemical plant disaster in Bhopal, India and attempted, unsuccessfully, to deliver seven barrels of that toxic waste to the Dow Chemical Company HQ in Amsterdam. The action spoke directly to basic questions of fairness and power: \u201cIf you can dump this toxic sludge on the people of India, then we can dump it back on you.\u201d Why is one act illegal while its analogue goes unpunished?\nTurning the tables poses this question in a pointed, common sense way, exposing hypocrisy and injustice for all to see. It\u2019s an easy frame for mainstream media to grasp, and difficult for them to distort.

How is it framed, and what does that frame leave out?\nCharacters\nThis can be a profound organizing question: Who are \u201cwe\u201d? Who are the other characters in the story? Do the characters speak for themselves or is someone speaking on their behalf see PRINCIPLE: Lead with sympathetic characters?\nImagery\nWhat powerful images can help convey the story? Is there a metaphor or analogy that could describe the issue? A good story uses imagery and evocative language to show us what\u2019s at stake rather than tell the audience what to think see PRINCIPLE: Show, don\u2019t tell.\nForeshadowing\nWhat is our vision of resolution to the conflict? What is our solution to the problem? How do we evoke that desired resolution without, as it were, giving the end away? see TACTIC: Prefigurative intervention.\nAssumptions\nEvery story is built on unstated assumptions. Sometimes the best way to challenge a competing story is to expose and challenge its unstated assumptions see PRINCIPLE: Make the invisible visible.\nThese five elements of story can be used together to conduct a narrative power analysis on a dominant narrative or as scaffolding to construct a narrative of change see THEORY: Narrative power analysis.

Race, class, gender identity (real and perceived), age, appearance, immigration status, physical ability, being perceived as a \u201cleader,\u201d all change your relationship to the action; i.e. the risks of violence and arrest by the police and the potential legal and economic consequences of the action. Also remember that there are power dynamics within your action group. Pretending that they do not exist or ignoring them \u201cfor the good of the action,\u201d can compromise your ability to execute well, increasing risks\u2026\n\u2022 Some devices increase the risk of injury simply by design: U-locking your neck to a fifty-five gallon drum filled with concrete means that any attempt to move the drum could snap your neck. That is the point \u2014 you create this situation on purpose, or not at all\u2026\n\u2022 This kind of gear increases the \u201cstaying power\u201d of your action by creating a deep decision dilemma see PRINCIPLE for the opposition\u2026 But if you are lying down in front of a truck and the driver is not aware that you are there, then there is no decision dilemma, and no action logic see THEORY: Action logic. That is not direct action, it is an accident waiting to happen.\n\u2022 \u2026The best actions are the ones where we get to stay as long as we want and the action ends on our terms \u2014 not in arrest or injury.\n\u2022 Practice. Practice. Practice. The more you practice, the safer you will be and the more effective your action will be.\nSome tactics should never be attempted without a thorough safety plan and skill-level assessment, such as a technical (climbing) banner hang where a fall can often prove fatal. Direct action is not a game.\nBe humble. Understand that Beautiful Trouble is intended to be a broad toolkit, not a direct action training manual. If you want to design a direct action, get the proper training (see the attached list of groups).\n\n\nBy Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/take-risks-but-take-care\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Saftey First\/PR_Safety First_NVDR training.jpg","links":[104127,100191,100146,100207,100175,100148,100149,100128,100245,100150,204970,200526,200222,200248,100177,100240,100127,100161,100173,200126,200260,200224,200238,300261,300204,300287,400145,500397,200132,200190,400210,400157,400236]},{"id":200232,"type":1,"title":"Take leadership from the most impacted","text":"Effective activism requires providing appropriate support to, and taking direction from, those who have the most at stake. We\u2019re all familiar with liberal do-gooder arrogance \u2014 the kind that stems from having the luxury of choosing from a salad bar of causes because none are immediately constraining their lives, or assuming that because you studied an issue in a university, you\u2019re an expert. Avoid being that person: cultivate humility and take direction and leadership from those most affected by an issue.\nBecause people on the receiving end of great injustices have to live with the consequences of campaigns that seek to address those injustices, they have the most to gain from victory \u2014 and the most to lose if something goes wrong. They\u2019re also the best equipped to know, and to articulate, workable solutions to their problems. A campaign that ignores or minimizes their knowledge and voices could easily do more harm than good.\nAccepting guidance from another isn\u2019t always easy for people who themselves identify as leaders. Self-identified \u201cleaders\u201d sometimes rush in too quickly, confident they\u2019ve got the answer while their preconceptions and prejudices blind them to the organic answers all around them. We can mitigate these blindspots by being intentional about respecting the process and cultivating accountability.\nAccountability can be a scary concept for activists, but it\u2019s best to think of it as a proactive process that we walk together, rather than a standard that is either achieved or not.\nThe booklet Organizing Cools the Planet outlines four basic principles for cultivating accountability:[1]\nTransparency means being clear about your politics, organizational structure, goals, desires and weaknesses. The point here is to be as open as possible about your perspectives and motivations.\nParticipation is about actively and equitably engaging with folks about the decisions that affect them.\nReflection and deliberation means that we actively open up conversation to re-evaluate where we\u2019re headed. It happens after participation, but once it\u2019s begun, it is a continuous thread that is woven throughout the experience.\nResponse is the ability to make amendments and adjustments to issues raised by Reflection and deliberation.\nHowever, accountability is not our goal; collaboration is our goal. Accountability is the pathway we walk. The cycle above moves us toward increasingly successful collaborations. Don\u2019t be discouraged if collaboration is difficult at first. Trust takes time. Be forgiving of yourself and others; we all make mistakes see THEORY: Anti-oppression.\nThe Ruckus Society\u2019s experience with this principle is instructive. Ruckus is a network of direct action trainers and coordinators. After years of grappling with the problematic dynamic of \u201cparachuters\u201d coming into people\u2019s communities from the outside, Ruckus has developed a protocol where they only go where they\u2019re asked and prioritize long-term relationship building. Their \u201cRuckus Action Framework\u201d is a great reference tool to use when building a similar protocol within your group.[2]\nTaking leadership from the most impacted is a great opportunity to learn from and support impacted groups in their struggles. It can be one of the most profound and rewarding experiences of activism.\n\n\n\t[1] Hilary Moore and Joshua Kahn Russell, Organizing Cools the Planet (Oakland, CA: PM Press, 2011). &#x21A9;\n\t[2] The framework is reproduced on page 54 of Organizing Cools the Planet, available for download at http:\/\/organizingcoolstheplanet.wordpress.com\/get-copies-of-ocp\/. &#x21A9;\nBy Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/take-leadership-from-the-most-impacted\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Take Leadership from the Most Impacted\/PR_Take Leadership from the Most Impacted_Accountability Cycle.jpg","links":[104800,100175,100143,100149,100128,100245,200221,200250,200260,100171,100191,200187,200268,200180,300203,300246,300263,300261,400196,400157,404526,404749,405156,500320,500348,500362,500385,200220,200132,200133,200271,200136,200190,300140,300209,300169,300200,300262,400188,400159,400163,400254]},{"id":200244,"type":1,"title":"Stay on message","text":"When we stay on message, we communicate exactly what we want our audience to know. We create harmony between our words, visuals and actions and we deliver a clear, powerful and irresistible call to action. Message discipline is the art of communicating what you set out to communicate, clearly, memorably and consistently. Everything from your talking points for an interview to the slogans on your banner to the visuals you create for an event should all align to support your core message.\nWHY MESSAGE DISCIPLINE MATTERS:\nIt works: When you\u2019re on message, you\u2019re more likely to reach your audience and move them to action.\nIt honors your group process: You\u2019ve worked hard with your group to determine what needs to be communicated. Staying on message honors that hard work and strategic thinking, communicating only what all of you have agreed is the right message.\nMake it stick: Say one thing and say it well. The average person needs exposure to multiple sensory impressions of a message before it sinks in. When you practice message discipline, the consistency of your message helps make it stick.\nAvoid static in the channel:\u00a0 Anything you say or do can be used against you in the court of public opinion, so make sure your words and actions are in sync with your group\u2019s message. Strip away any of the clutter that could be static in the channel. Remember: less is more.\nHOW TO ACHIEVE IT:\nIn interviews: Spokesfolks should practice the ABC\u2019s: acknowledge the question, build a bridge from the question to your talking points; and communicate your message.\nExample:\nA\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great question\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked that.\u201d\nB\n\u201cI think the important issue is\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe real question is\u2026\u201d\nC\nInsert your clear, concise, powerfully worded message.\nIn our visuals and actions: When designing your action, imagine a photo of it \u2014 image only, no caption. Could that photo communicate your message? If your audience could see you from afar but not hear you, would they get your message? How can you increase that possibility? See THEORY: Action logic.\nInventory your event: Everything your audience sees or hears at your action is inevitably a part of your message, so pay attention to details. What are your spokesfolks wearing? Are they drinking out of a Styrofoam cup? A bit of mindfulness as your event unfolds can ensure the impact you desire.\nMessage discipline is not the enemy of creativity. Far from it. Placards can have different messages. Each spokesperson can share a sound bite that reflects their own unique experience. But when you are \u201con message,\u201d all elements reinforce your core message. Each action element or interview response stands on its own, successfully delivering a strong message to your audience with clarity, consistency and credibility.\n\nBy Celia Alario","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/stay-on-message\/","links":[100272,100218,100148,100198,200223,104127,200180,200134,200130,200241,200220,200158,300228,300142,300287,300540,404526,405098,500302,200199,200249,200233,200126,300204,300263,300179,400172,400170]},{"id":200229,"type":1,"title":"Simple rules can have grand results","text":"Movements, viral campaigns and large-scale actions can\u2019t be scripted from the top down. An invitation to participate and the right set of simple rules are often all the starter-structure you need. In 1986, computer scientists did an experiment on \u201cemergence \u2014 where complex global behavior can arise\u201d unplanned and unprogrammed \u201cfrom the interaction of simple local rules.\u201d[1] They created virtual birds called \u201cboids.\u201d (The computer scientists must have been from Brooklyn.) They put these boids in a virtual environment and threw in a few virtual obstacles. They assigned every boid the same three simple rules: fly forwards, stay a certain distance from any other boids near you and don\u2019t bang into obstacles. Then they threw the switch. The birds flocked together. As the flock approached a cloud, it would break up into smaller flocks to either side, and then reform \u2014 all without the idea of flocking ever being programmed into the system.\nThis experiment was a stripped-down demonstration of something we experience in nature and society all the time \u2014 and something activists can put to good use.\nIf you\u2019re trying to organize a participatory art piece, a mass action or a viral campaign, you don\u2019t need to script it all out \u2014 even if you could. All you need are a few simple rules that participants can sign on to. If you hit on the right rules, they can lead to a surprisingly robust, effective and beautiful happening.\nThink of Critical Mass, the monthly mass bike rides that take place in cities across the world. The rules are simple: Gather after work on the last Friday of the month. Stick together. If you\u2019re at the front, you decide where the mass goes next. If you\u2019re at the back, help stragglers keep up. If you\u2019re in the middle, just ride, or, if you want, protect other bikers from cross-traffic. No one and everyone is in charge. It\u2019s an \u201corganized coincidence.\u201d And it works.\nFlash mobs operate by the same logic. The call for a 2008 flash mob pillow fight on Wall Street consisted of two rules: Bring a pillow, and don\u2019t hit anybody who doesn\u2019t also have a pillow. Enough said!\nThese kind of efforts work well on the Internet as well. Think of the \u201cwe are the 99%\u201d tumblr. The invitation was simple: take a picture of yourself holding a sign that describes your situation \u2014 for example, \u201cI am a student with $25,000 in debt.\u201d Below that, write \u201cI am the\u00a099 percent.\u201d The resulting tapestry of voices became an eloquent statement of solidarity.\nA carnival protest might succeed with an \u201canything goes\u201d rule set, because, well, it\u2019s a carnival. A more politically focused mass street action see CASE: Citizen\u2019s Posse or viral campaign of distributed actions see CASE: Billionaires for Bush, however, often needs a stronger framework. The nature of your action, its complexity, and the degree of risk will determine the exact rules required.\nHOW THE OPPOSITE IS EQUALLY TRUE: Simple rules, no matter how well chosen, won\u2019t magically do all the work on their own. Often, conveners (folks who make the invitation and set the rules) have to stage manage all along the way to keep the seemingly organic process going. The right set of simple rules can get you most of the way there, though, and the \u201cthere\u201d might be somewhere you never could have planned or imagined.\n\n\n\t[1] Boids: Background and Update, Craig Reynolds, 1986 . http:\/\/www.red3d.com\/cwr\/boids\/ &#x21A9;\nBy Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/simple-rules-can-have-grand-results\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Dont Mistake Your Group for Society\/PR_Dont Mistake Group fro Society_Flock of Geese.jpg","links":[105009,100193,100138,100148,100230,200223,100146,200181,200270,200189,200135,200260,300228,300209,300201,400144,400168,400159,400253,404842,405098,405156,500346,500294,500371,500350,500395,400236]},{"id":200130,"type":1,"title":"Show, don&#8217;t tell","text":"Use metaphor, visuals and action to show your message rather than falling into preaching, hectoring or otherwise telling your audience what to think. A picture is worth a thousand words. In today\u2019s image-driven news cycle and mass media culture, this is truer than ever. Effective creative campaigns must be image-driven, too. In other words, show, don\u2019t tell. And there are lot of ways to do it.\nLead with story, not facts. Facts rarely speak for themselves. While the factual accuracy of your message is essential, facts should only serve as the supporting details for the story, not the hook that makes the story compelling.\nIf you want to convey the devastation of unemployment, don\u2019t lead with statistics. Tell us a compelling story about one person. Then tell us there are ten million more like her out there.\nMake it visual. A lot of important stuff is hard to\u00a0talk about \u2014 it\u2019s too big, far away, abstract or complex. Props, visuals and concrete language can help bring things down to human scale. Take economic inequality, for example. You can easily get lost in the finer points of the tax code, but when billionaire Warren Buffet says that his secretary pays more taxes than he does, and that that\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s hard to argue with. To draw attention to the increasing disparity between CEO and worker pay, one group unveiled a tiny replica of the Washington Monument that was 419 times smaller than the actual one they were holding their press conference in front of.\nUse powerful metaphors. With metaphor you can show something for what it is, rather than have to explain it. To find your compelling metaphor, look for something that embodies what you are trying to communicate. Recently, the immigration debate in the U.S. has been usefully engaged via the metaphor of migratory birds (\u201cDo migrating birds need passports too?\u201d), neatly pointing up the absurdity of the situation, without focusing on any specific policy or piece of legislation.\nSpeak with actions. Instead of telling, act out what it is that you want to say. At protests, whenever there are lines of police protecting a bank, a metaphor is being enacted that reflects the reality of the situation: the state defends the wealthy from the rest of us. Sometimes it\u2019s enough to just point that out \u2014 or you can ham it up see CASE: Teddy bear catapult.\nA well-designed action explains itself, and ideally offers multiple ways into the issue. You want your audience to reach their own conclusion, rather than feeling like they are being told what to think.\nPreachy isn\u2019t persuasive. Whether we\u2019re telling a story, conjuring a scene, offering up a metaphor, leading by example, or letting our actions speak volumes, there are millions of ways to convey our message and values without launching into a political diatribe.

Determine the social blocs at play on a given issue, and work to shift them closer to your position.  Activists are often good at analyzing systemic social problems, but less good at thinking systemically about organizing.\nActivism is about using your power and voice to make change. Organizing is about that, too, but it\u2019s also about activating and empowering others. It helps to think in terms of groups. Successful movement-building hinges on being able to see a society in terms of specific blocs or networks, some of which are institutions (unions, churches, schools), others of which are less visible or cohesive, like youth subcultures or demographic groupings.\nAnalyzing your spectrum of allies can help you to identify and mobilize the networks around you. A spectrum-of-allies analysis can be used to map out a campaign or to strategize for a whole social movement.\nHere\u2019s how a spectrum-of-allies analysis works: in each wedge you can place different individuals (be specific: name them!), groups, or institutions. Moving from left to right, identify your active allies: people who agree with you and are fighting alongside you; your passive allies: folks who agree with you but aren\u2019t doing anything about it; neutrals: fence sitters, the unengaged; passive opposition: people who disagree with you but aren\u2019t trying to stop you; and finally your active opposition.\nSome activist groups only speak or work with those in the first wedge (active allies), building insular, self-referential, marginal subcultures that are incomprehensible to everyone else. Others behave as if everyone is in the last wedge (active opposition), playing out the \u201cstory of the righteous few,\u201d acting as if the whole world is against them. Both of these approaches virtually guarantee failure. Movements win not by overpowering their active opposition, but by shifting the support out from under them.\nFor example, in 1964, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a major driver of the civil rights movement in the U.S. South, conducted a \u201cspectrum-of-allies style\u201d analysis. They determined that they had a lot of passive allies who were students in the North: these students were sympathetic, but had no entry point into the movement. They didn\u2019t need to be \u201ceducated\u201d or convinced, they needed an invitation to enter.\nTo shift these allies from \u201cpassive\u201d to \u201cactive,\u201d SNCC sent buses north to bring folks down to participate in the struggle under the banner \u201cFreedom Summer.\u201d Students came in droves, and many were deeply radicalized in the process, witnessing lynching, violent police abuse, and angry white mobs, all simply as a result of black activists trying to vote.\nMany wrote letters home to their parents, who suddenly had a personal connection to the struggle. This triggered another shift: their families became passive allies, often bringing their workplaces and social networks with them. The students, meanwhile, went back to school in the fall and proceeded to organize their campuses. More shifts. The result: a profound transformation of the political landscape of the U.S. This cascading shift of support, it\u2019s important to emphasize, wasn\u2019t spontaneous; it was part of a deliberate movement strategy that, to this day, carries profound lessons for other movements.\n\nBy Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/shift-the-spectrum-of-allies\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/spectrum2.jpg","links":[105009,100143,100149,200221,200212,200153,200132,200182,200269,200241,200180,300204,400196,400152,400157,400188,400172,500297,500379,200199,200131,200187,200139,300209,300169,300259,300205,400256]},{"id":200199,"type":1,"title":"Seek common ground","text":"In search of allies and points of agreement, we must grow comfortable adopting the rhetoric of worldviews we might otherwise oppose. When disagreeing with someone else\u2019s ideas, it can be tempting to engage in narrative attack; to make a direct attack on one narrative from the vantage point, and in the language, of your opposing narrative. For example, when someone wraps climate change\u2013denial views in the rhetoric of creationist beliefs, it is tempting to directly attack the climate change denier\u2019s whole belief system. Once a narrative attack is made, persuasion becomes nearly impossible because the attacked person feels that their whole belief system is under siege. Change becomes impossible.\nA narrative insurgency approach, on the other hand, examines the other\u2019s narrative framework, learning the component parts and looking for points of connection. Rather than directly attack a creationist\u2019s whole belief system, for instance, a \u201cnarrative insurgent\u201d looks to foment home-grown insurgency against the most problematic beliefs by identifying ally beliefs and seeking to reinforce them. When speaking to creationists about environmental issues, for example, emphasizing humanity\u2019s mandate to care for God\u2019s creation can be an effective point of entry.\nIf we are to transform the political culture, we need to think not in terms of attacking opponents\u2019 views head-on, but rather in terms of fomenting homegrown insurgency. The root of the word insurgency is \u201crise up.\u201d Insurgencies rise up from within. Narrative insurgency rises up from within a cultural narrative, transforming that culture from the inside out.\nThe narrative insurgent\u2019s approach, well executed, can be very effective for identifying and drawing out allies: in this case, creationists who care about the environment and are uneasy seeing it ravaged for the sake of private profit. By repeating and positively reinforcing this message in the context of ongoing engagement, the belief that we should care for the earth can be strengthened within the given community\u2019s complex collective belief system.\nNarrative insurgents do not reject problematic narratives wholesale, but distinguish between those components that are allied, hostile or neutral to their cause. They embrace as much of a cultural narrative as possible \u2014 the allied and neutral components \u2014 and encourage the further development of the allied components, using these as the foundations for their organizing efforts with and within the given community.\nThis approach doesn\u2019t mean always avoiding direct confrontation with harmful narratives and beliefs. It\u2019s more like a preference for finding common ground and utilizing positive reinforcement whenever possible. Ultimately there comes a time when a destructive narrative becomes untenable to a critical mass of people, and when a new polarization will be useful (e.g. during a revolutionary moment). The strategy here is to lay the groundwork that necessarily precedes such a moment: to feed the allied components within a narrative until they are strong enough to burst out of the old framework.\nNarrative insurgency only works if applied in the context of accountable relationships with reliable feedback loops. A change agent learns the intricacies of cultural narratives not to deceive people, but to communicate common values in a language that holds meaning for large numbers of people. While she may often disagree with others, she still values and even empathizes with their perspectives. She is forgiving toward shortcomings, always rooting for people, always finding something worthy of praise. Over time, narrative insurgency becomes second nature: we don\u2019t feign identification with the allied and neutral components within another community\u2019s narrative or culture, because our orientation is to connect with people wherever and whenever possible.\n\nBy Jonathan Matthew Smucker","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/seek-common-ground\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/GOD-IS-GREEN.jpg","links":[100234,100226,201558,200241,200247,100127,100239,200137,200237,200182,200231,200244,200264,200180,300263,300243,300209,300540,400194,400160,200139,200190,300228,300192,400170,400162,400267,400156]},{"id":200182,"type":1,"title":"Reframe","text":"The easiest way to win an argument is to redefine the terms of the debate.

Reframing often involves making the invisible visible see PRINCIPLE by highlighting aspects of the story that have been left out of the dominant story.\nNext, design a reframing action that seeks to relocate the story. Redirect the public\u2019s focus to the scene of the crime to reveal a villain, whether it\u2019s a corporate boardroom or a CEO\u2019s seventh home. Use an emblematic location tied to an historical narrative, like a monument or a park with a name that is significant in the story (Liberty Plaza Park or a Christopher Columbus statue for instance). Tie your action to high-profile events or dates that are soon to follow, framing and foreshadowing the public conversation around those celebrations. For instance, on Tax Day posing as tax collectors at the HQs of the Big Banks and trying to get them to pay their proper share might reframe the public discussion of tax evasion.\nIf you expand your reframing action into a campaign, you might succeed in injecting powerful new memes into the media and policy discourse. Adam Kader of the Arise Workers Center in Chicago offers this example:\n&#8220;Institutions like the Department of Labor and the mainstream media referred to the phenomena of worker exploitation as \u201cnon-payment of wages.\u201d Then, several years ago, worker centers designed the \u201cwage theft\u201d meme. This meme overthrows the dominant assumption that wages are the property of the boss, to be shared with workers. Rather, in this new narrative, wages are the property of workers, and have been stolen by the boss. . . . The media has begun to use the meme when they report on our campaigns and legislators have incorporated the phrase \u201cwage theft\u201d in the names of bills&#8221;.[1]\nEffective creative action should serve the larger strategic goal of provoking a shift in the public conversation. Reframing is often a critical step to winning a campaign and making real change.\n\n\n\t[1] Adam Kader, \u201cStorytelling as Organizing: How to Rescue the Left from its Crisis of Imagination,\u201d In These Times, January 10, 2011, http:\/\/www.inthesetimes.com\/working\/entry\/6824\/ &#x21A9;\nBy Doyle Canning and Patrick Reinsborough","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/reframe\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Reframe\/PR_Reframe_Wage Theft.jpg","links":[104127,100239,100184,100234,100177,100226,100272,100218,100150,100161,201558,200212,200264,200255,200241,200130,200237,200199,100149,200154,300228,300263,300540,400151,400145,400185,400188,500320,500391,200220,200231,200180,200139,200190,300142,300204,300179,300206,300192,400194,400251,400196,400252,400265,400163,400267,400166,400167,400168,400156]},{"id":200238,"type":1,"title":"Put your target in a decision dilemma","text":"Design your action so that your target is forced to make a decision, and all their available options play to your advantage. If you design your action well, you can force your target into a situation where they have to respond, but have no good options \u2014 where they\u2019re damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t. In fact, many actions with concrete goals (such as blockades, sit-ins, tree-sits, etc.) require such a \u201cdecision dilemma\u201d in order to be successful.\nConsider the blockade of a building. A tactically effective blockade leaves your target with only two options: 1) negotiate with you \/ meet your demands, or 2) react with force (violence against you or arrest). That\u2019s a decision dilemma. Don\u2019t let your target walk out the back door, and don\u2019t put yourself in a situation where they can wait you out with impunity. You must force a clear decision dilemma. Without it, you let your target and\/or the police determine the success of your action, rather than calling the shots yourself. Be sure to cover all the exits \u2014 literally or figuratively.\nCreative activists can adapt this tactical insight to force their target into a similar dilemma on the symbolic level.\nTake Cindy Sheehan. In the summer of 2005, after the death of her son, Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, in the Iraq War, she camped out in front of President Bush\u2019s Texas ranch where he had just begun a three-week vacation. Quoting Bush\u2019s own words back to him, she vowed not to leave until he met with her to explain for what \u201cnoble cause\u201d her son had died.\nOnce the media started covering the standoff, Bush was trapped in a decision dilemma: he was damned if he did meet with her, damned if he didn\u2019t. Meeting with her would\u2019ve been a media fiasco. Not meeting with her conceded her point. Either way he lost. In the end, he never met with Sheehan, and \u201cCamp Casey\u201d became one of the key watershed moments that turned American public opinion against the war.\nOr consider the Whose Tea Party? action see CASE. GOP Congressmen gathered on the Boston Tea Party ship for a set-piece media stunt: tossing a trunk labelled \u201ctax code\u201d into the harbor. But they were suddenly confronted by a dinghy of activists \u2014 \u201cthe Working Family Life Raft\u201d \u2014 in the water beneath them, pleading not to be swamped by the proposed flat tax. With cameras rolling, the target had two choices: either toss the tax code in and sink the raft (as they did) or back down on their declared intention to dispose of the tax code. By throwing it in and capsizing the raft, they played into the activists\u2019 story that the GOP\u2019s proposed tax reform would \u201csink the working family.\u201d Backing down would also have undermined the GOP argument by symbolically conceding that the tax would be harmful to working families. As with Camp Casey, this decision dilemma was not a happy accident, but a key design element of the action.\nOften, for this principle to work, you have to be prepared to wait out your opponent. Cindy Sheehan committed to camping outside Bush\u2019s ranch for the duration of his vacation. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere. It was his move, and he didn\u2019t have one. Similarly, the Working Family Life Raft bobbed in the water, pleading for the GOP to spare working families while the media documented the event. Unlike a lot of actions, there were no security guards to clear them out. They could just wait, and the more the GOPers hesitated, the more they reinforced the protesters\u2019 message.\n\nBy Andrew Boyd and Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/put-your-target-in-a-decision-dilemma\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Put Your Target in a Decision Dilemma\/PR_Put Your Target in a Decision Dilemma_Cindy.jpg","links":[100191,100146,100184,100175,100240,100226,100218,100149,100128,100245,100186,100161,204970,200526,200222,200248,200255,200227,300287,300263,300204,300205,400194,400266,405098,500379,500371,500375,200233,200131,200219,200137,200153,300209,300169,300202,400188,400265,400236]},{"id":200249,"type":1,"title":"Put movies in the hands of movements","text":"By telling a personal story, documentary film can make an otherwise difficult-to-approach issue accessible. Filmmakers and activists, working together, can collaborate to make a film a story-driven lever for change. Story-driven documentaries change minds, attitudes and policies. But they reach their fullest potential when tightly woven into the campaigns and events of organizers working on the issues. As activist filmmakers, here are a couple of key rules my colleagues and I have learned:\nCreate mutually beneficial relationships between filmmakers and organizers. Authentic partnerships start with the filmmaker asking the movement, \u201cWhat can my film do for you?\u201d Not, \u201cwhat can you do for my film?\u201d Certainly, the movement has much to offer the filmmaker\u00a0in return (and we\u2019ll get to that) but it\u2019s important to\u00a0begin with this frame.\nLook for five to ten organizations to partner with \u2014 some might be small and scrappy, others may have national reach. Ask them for the strategy; don\u2019t guess. Effective conversations start with questions like: \u201cWhat are your current programs and priorities and how could our film support them?\u201d \u201cWhat do you want audiences to do when the lights come up?\u201d Partner organizations have resources to offer in return: online tools that can be embedded into a film\u2019s website, information that can be added to a film\u2019s screening guide or curriculum, constituents and allies eager to spread the word, and actions that audience members can take. All of this creates a cycle which builds momentum for both the film and the movement.\nMove from \u201cfilm timeline\u201d to \u201corganizing timeline.\u201d The first year or so of a film\u2019s life is driven by the film timeline: you take it around the festival circuit, bring it to theaters or community events and, if you\u2019re lucky, broadcast it. This is a great time to experiment together. For example, you might try out a mobile app where you ask festival audiences to sign a petition while they are still in their seats.\nBut at a certain point, a filmmaker shifts to \u201corganizing time\u201d \u2014 especially when there is a timely, urgent ongoing campaign that needs the film. Community screenings, house parties, online streaming: all these traditional venues for distribution can be utilized strategically by organizations and individual activists on the ground. They might use screening events to get more folks to sign up for an upcoming national day of action and then use clips to energize the crowd on the day of the action. Or they might use house party screenings and discussions to mobilize their constituents around a pending piece of legislation that needs that extra push. At this stage, a campaign\u2019s needs and timeline inform when and how the film is used and catalyze the long-term change everyone is working toward.\n\n\nBy Judith Helfand and Anna Lee","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/put-movies-in-the-hands-of-movements\/","links":[200130,100272,200241,200244,200158,200134,200231,200154,300263,300204,300246,300243,300200,200220]},{"id":200268,"type":1,"title":"Praxis makes perfect","text":"Theory without action produces armchair revolutionaries. Action without reflection produces ineffective or counter-productive activism. That\u2019s why we have praxis: a cycle of theory, action and reflection that helps us analyze our efforts in order to improve our ideas. Effective activism follows a cycle. We start with our theory of how change happens. Then we take action based on our theory. Then we take a step back and reflect on how the action went, which re-shapes our theory. Basically, praxis means \u201clearning.\u201d It may seem simple, but few activists actually do it.\nPraxis requires us to be students of our own experience and context. It\u2019s not just about being smart and reflecting. It\u2019s also about building specific behaviors and group norms that promote habits of strategy, debrief and revision. It\u2019s about your group\u2019s meeting style, organizational structure and leadership dynamics.\nHere\u2019s the difference that praxis can make:\nLet\u2019s say we\u2019re in a student group at a college. If our group lacks praxis, we may say: \u201cLet\u2019s bring Radical Thinker X to speak at our campus!\u201d We affirm that the event will be \u201cgood.\u201d Then we have the event. It\u2019s somewhat well-attended, but afterwards our group has mixed feelings about it. We decide to keep moving forward and host another event.\nThat\u2019s a bit directionless. There was no actual theory, and no basis for reflection.\nInstead, let\u2019s start with a theory. We start our group meeting by saying \u201cBringing Radical Thinker X to campus will help our campaign. They can talk about why activism is powerful, and it will reach a new audience of people who are not yet engaged in our campaign. Let\u2019s post fliers in our favorite coffee shops. Three hundred people will attend, fifty will sign up, and five of those people will show up at our next meeting.\u201d\nNow that\u2019s a real theory. It has an explicit logic, a process of how you will do your action, and concrete measurable outcomes that you expect.\nThe event happens. Only one hundred people attend and most of them already work with your group, so only a few sign your list, and nobody new comes to your next meeting.\nYou now have a real basis for reflection. You can debrief your event, and instead of subjectively talking about whether you thought it was \u201cgood\u201d or not, you can have a conversation about why it didn\u2019t measure up to your success indicators, and what to do next time. These lessons shape how you do your next event.\nOrganizers should have the praxis cycle spinning in their heads all the time. We are always learning from what\u2019s going on around us. The point of building a culture of praxis in your group, however, is so your whole group can learn, not just a couple of organizers. When you develop your theory (your plan and your goals) with your group, and then have a real debrief after, the lessons are available to all. If you don\u2019t take real time out to name your theories, and then reflect, revise, and learn lessons, you will be left spinning your wheels, with fewer and fewer people understanding how to do the work of your group.\n\nBy Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/praxis-makes-perfect\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Praxis Makes Perfect\/PR_Praxis Makes Perfect_Praxis wheel.jpg","links":[100174,100273,200232,200132,200187,300209,300259,300204,300263,300246,200131,200231,200271,200136,200153,300140]},{"id":200233,"type":1,"title":"Play to the audience that isn&#8217;t there","text":"In a hyper-mediated world, often the audience you care about is not the one in the room with you, but the one you\u2019ll reach through mass and social media. Design your action with them in mind. When you\u2019re pulling off a prank or staging some kind of media spectacle, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that those you\u2019re directly confronting are often not your main audience. When Occupy Wall Street activists swarm Manhattan\u2019s financial district or Bhopal activists camp out on the lawn of the CEO of Union Carbide, there\u2019s no reason to think that the immediate audience will change their minds based on what they\u2019re observing. Rather, the idea is to use the immediate audience as unwitting actors in a theater piece that is being performed for a secondary audience. That secondary audience is comprised of filmgoers or YouTube viewers or TV watchers or press-release readers \u2014 and they\u2019re the ones you care most about. Design your intervention with them in mind.\nIf reporters are going to be present, consider how things will look through their eyes. Regardless, however, make sure to document your own action see PRINCIPLE: Do the media\u2019s work for them. Choreograph the action so you create and capture the moments you need to tell the story you want to tell. When Agit-Pop pulled off their Public Option Annie guerrilla musical see CASE, they snuck more videographers into the conference than singers.\nObviously, the secondary audience is not always your focus. At a rally, say, the key audience might actually be the participants themselves. With most strikes or sit-ins, the key audience is the actual target \u2014 a CEO or public official \u2014 and your aim is to disrupt business as usual and exact a cost that will pressure your target to accede to your demands.\nBut even with some of these more disruptive actions, the key audience is not in the room. When Tim DeChristopher disrupted a Utah oil and gas auction in 2008 see CASE: Bidder 70, he was not tempted to address the other bidders directly. His action was for a much larger audience \u2014 as well as for the land itself that he helped to save.\nSometimes activists think they\u2019re out to change the minds of the bankers, CEOs, or others they\u2019re ostensibly targeting. It\u2019s one thing to pretend you\u2019re out to change their minds \u2014 in order to stage a theatrically effective action, that is often necessary \u2014 but it\u2019s another thing to believe it yourself. The idea that you can change evildoers\u2019 minds by gathering en masse outside their stronghold is not exactly supported by the historical record. Instead, think of your target and your immediate audience as unwitting actors in the theater piece you\u2019re concocting for another audience they\u2019re not even aware of.\nHOW THE OPPOSITE IS EQUALLY TRUE: Sometimes this principle is absolutely wrong. Sometimes the media and the public will see right through an action that is too heavy-handedly crafted for TV. Sometimes the best way to connect with the indirect audience is just to be your unvarnished, authentic self, warts and all see CASE: Occupy Wall Street.\n\nBy Andy Bichlbaum and Andrew Boyd","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/play-to-the-audience-that-isnt-there\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Play to the Audience that isnt there\/PR_Play to the Audience that isnt there_TV.jpg","links":[100146,100184,100234,100226,100127,100195,100218,100186,100161,200526,100173,100240,200134,200244,200130,200220,200190,200238,200129,200211,400151,400152,404604,404842,500775,500040,500383,200180,200126,400194,400251,400213,400266,400166,400156]},{"id":200224,"type":1,"title":"Pace yourself","text":"Taking care of ourselves and having fun in our work for social change are essential to building stronger, larger, more effective movements. Too often, the people doing the most to take care of the world do the least to take care of themselves. It happens far too frequently that a dedicated activist suddenly (or not so suddenly, for those who know them best) burns out and disappears from public view. This scenario is common enough, and represents a large enough threat to our collective success, that it warrants serious discussion and soul-searching within our movements. Specifically, we need to talk about how to take care of ourselves and each other so we can stay involved for the long haul.\nWhether we like it or not, activists are walking advertisements for our movements. If we are exhausted, frustrated, overwhelmed or unhappy most of the time, we make a life of activism look extremely unattractive to the average person. Virtually every activist has struggled with the question of how to get beyond \u201cpreaching to the choir.\u201d A first step is to make \u201cthe choir\u201d the sort of place lots of people will want to join.\nIt is also important to ensure that pragmatic self-care is not seen as selfish or bourgeois. If we don\u2019t take time to focus on our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual selves, we will burn out sooner or later. It\u2019s almost guaranteed. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to take regular breaks to nurture yourself, rather than get to the point where you have to take months or years off because you are too sick or depressed to be involved?\nActivists are frequently motivated by guilt, and will unconsciously use guilt to motivate others. Guilt is a dangerous motivator because it will never be satisfied, and is rooted in a sense of external obligation rather than internal passion. A better motivator, for those who have some degree of privilege and feel guilty about that, is gratitude. Coming to this work from gratitude gives us energy without sucking us into despair and self-judgment.\nThese are deadly serious questions. Long-time Canadian activist Tooker Gomberg took his own life in 2004 after a long battle with depression and burn-out. Before he died, he wrote a letter to social change activists. Do the activism, he said, but don\u2019t overdo it:\n&#8220;It\u2019s honorable to work to change the world, but do it in balance with other things. Explore and embrace the things you love to do, and you\u2019ll be energetic and enthusiastic about the activism. Don\u2019t drop hobbies or enjoyments. Be sure to hike and dance and sing. Keeping your spirit alive and healthy is fundamental if you are to keep going.&#8221;[1]\nIt is important to take a long view of activism, to remember those who came before us and those who will come after. This can help us build on the work of previous generations and learn from their mistakes and\u00a0triumphs, so that we are not always starting from scratch. We cannot carry all of the weight of the world\u2019s problems on our shoulders; we must simply accept, with gratitude, the opportunity to do what we can today.\n\n\n\t[1] Tooker Gomberg, \u201cLetter to an Activist, Earth Day 2002\u201d (Greenspiration.org) &#x21A9;\nBy Tracey Mitchell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/pace-yourself\/","links":[100171,200227,200269,200135,200250,300201,300202,200190,300178]},{"id":200189,"type":1,"title":"No one wants to watch a drum circle","text":"Participating in a drum circle is amazing, transformative and fun.

Experiencing it from the outside, quite another.\nWay too often, activism is like a drum circle. Viewed from the outside, it can be painfully unimaginative, solipsistic and quite simply annoying. For the people involved in the creation of an action, however, the experience can be rewarding and transformative \u2014 even if everyone else walks away confused or annoyed. If that happens and it doesn\u2019t bother you, you may have fallen prey to the political identity paradox see THEORY.\nOne way to reach your audience is to entice them to become participants by expanding the creative part of the action to include as many as possible. Come up with ways for observers to meaningfully involve themselves, instead of expecting them to stand mute before your expressive outbursts of creativity.\nInstead of strictly planning an action, think of creating rules to a game \u2014 one that is rewarding and fun to play see PRINCIPLE: Simple rules can have grand results. How can you create parameters within which large numbers of participants can meaningfully contribute, act, and create? An open framework that allows participants the freedom to bring in their own ideas and solutions?\nThe call to occupy Wall Street operated in this way, offering only a date, a core slogan, and the instruction Bring tent[1]. Flash mobs are no different: set a time, location, and a few basic rules, and let things take their course. These actions have simple rules that can expand to include thousands of participants and still deliver a provocative experience to participant and observer alike.\nIn any case, whatever the nature of your action, it\u2019s worth looking for ways to make passersby feel that it\u2019s more about them than about you.

Communicative ones can be more symbolic. Knowing the difference and planning accordingly is important. To varying degrees, all tactics might be concrete and communicative. When activists confuse the two, the results can be counter-productive.\nA tactic is concrete to the degree that it seeks to achieve a specific, quantifiable objective. For example, anti-war organizers may seek to blockade a port to keep a shipment of weapons from passing through. There is a specific goal, a tangible cost for the port and the companies that use it, and a way to evaluate success: either we stop the weapons or we don\u2019t.\nA tactic is communicative insomuch as it communicates a political position, set of values or worldview. A mass march in response to an injustice can fall into this category. Communicative tactics can be useful for exciting our base, building networks, seeking to sway public opinion, or scaring a target, but often do not have a specific, measurable, activating, realistic, time-bound (S.M.A.R.T.) goal. Success is more qualitative.\nTo succeed, concrete tactics must force a response from the target see PRINCIPLE: Put your target in a decision dilemma. Communicative tactics might have a target, but can also work without one.\nWhile some actions can be both communicative and concrete, it is important to understand the difference. People often get discouraged by direct action because they take part in a communicative action and expect a concrete outcome. It\u2019s better to be clear from the beginning about the difference, so that everyone knows how to measure, and contribute to, the action\u2019s impact[1]\nConsider an Occupy Wall Street effort to blockade the entrance to Goldman Sachs. At the action planning meeting, because there was no clarity about whether the action was communicative or concrete, at first the discussion was circular and unproductive. Some wanted people to lock arms in a simple human blockade see TACTIC: Blockade, others wanted to up the ante by using chains and other \u201chard gear.\u201d Using gear has the benefit of staying power (it\u2019s more difficult for the police to remove you), but it carries much greater risk and is more difficult to deploy. It became clear the group had neither time nor numbers to blockade every single exit. Therefore, if the action was conceived as concrete (trying to shut down Goldman Sachs), it would fail because it could not achieve a realistic instrumental outcome. If it was communicative, however \u2014 a symbolic act to amplify a message \u2014 it could be successful. Furthermore, a communicative action might have a powerful expressive outcome by building the resolve, connection and commitment of participants by offering them a cathartic, transformative experience. When participants agreed to carry out a communicative action, the staying power of the blockade gear was no longer needed: there was no tactical advantage to holding the space longer. Instead, the group decided to go with a human blockade, which played better in the media (a main indicator of success for them in this action). If activists hadn\u2019t assessed the purpose of their action and understood their goals, they likely would have made less strategic choices.\n\n\n\t[1] The categories \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201ccommunicative\u201d are ways to measure the instrumental outcome of an action, as opposed to its expressive dimension.

When you bring these wrongs into full view, you change the game, making the need to take action palpable. Social problems are often obscured by distance, ideology, or simple chemistry (when was the last time you noticed PCBs in your drinking water?). If you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t change it: the first task of an activist is often to make the invisible visible.\nThere are several kinds of \u201cinvisibility.\u201d Which one you\u2019re dealing with will shape the approach you take.\nDistance\nClimate chaos might be stranding polar bears in the Arctic or submerging small island nations in the Pacific, but for most people in the global north it\u2019s out of sight, out of mind. Countless artful interventions have sought to make accelerating climate changes more visible, whether by painting anticipated future sea levels on city streets and buildings or mock-drowning a polar bear in the fountain outside the Department of the Interior in D.C., as Greenpeace did in 2009.\nPeople with privilege often have the luxury of putting distance between themselves and the consequences of their actions. When tackling an issue that seems distant, it helps to bring the issue home see PRINCIPLE: Bring the issue home by highlighting the human cost.\nIdeology\nPeople who have the luxury of not seeing an uncomfortable truth often simply won\u2019t, even if it\u2019s in front of their faces. Privileged whites easily ignored the everyday injustices inflicted during the Jim Crow era until blacks organized and took action, sitting in the \u201cwrong\u201d seats in diners and on buses, marching in the streets, and so on.\nInjustices made invisible by ideology can be brought to light by judicious reframing see PRINCIPLE: Reframe. A frame defines what is part of the story and, more importantly, what is not. Actions that target the point of assumption (the simple question of who can sit where on a bus, for instance) can focus attention on what was previously \u201coutside the frame.\u201d\nChemistry, and other easily overlooked facts of life\nMany pollutants cannot be seen by the naked eye, yet cause great harm. The key is to bring that harm into public view. Consider the makers of the movie Gasland, who lit some Pennsylvania tap water on fire, powerfully refuting years of industry denial with a single powerful visual demonstration. Or the forest activists who filled several city intersections with the stumps of cut-down trees. When Kodak was caught discharging toxins from its manufacturing plant in upstate New York, Greenpeace created a public fountain that brought the effluent from the pipe \u2014 normally out of site below the water surface \u2014 cascading into public view. These kind of actions are particularly effective when the corporation has worked hard to hide or deny the damage, or simply done it far away from consumers.\nThe role of the activist often resembles that of the child in the Hans Christian Andersen story: even if everyone knows the emperor has no clothes, saying as much in public can have revolutionary consequences. Exposing previously hidden problems can be the first and most important step in resolving them.\n\n\nBy Nadine Bloch","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/make-the-invisible-visible\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Make the invisible visible\/PR_Make the invisible visible_Firewater.jpg","links":[100173,100207,100184,100177,100171,100272,100186,200264,200255,200241,200130,200182,200249,100150,100239,200183,200134,200231,300287,300204,300203,300263,300206,300540,400163,400267,400185,400157,400165,400265,400194,404604,404749,405156,500040,500285,500335,500308,500340,500329,500331,500358,500364,500366,500373,200187,200158,300246,300200,300261,300258,300208,400210,400256,400196,400252,400254,400144,400156]},{"id":200269,"type":1,"title":"Make new folks welcome","text":"Recruitment and retention go hand in hand. A few simple procedures for orienting new participants can go a long way to ensuring their ongoing involvement. Bringing in new participants is essential to any activist group that wants to grow in size and capacity \u2014 but recruiting is only the first step. Integrating people into an established group can be a much bigger challenge, and it helps to be intentional about it. Getting good at involving people requires some deliberate attention and probably the establishment of some basic procedures to make new folks welcome.\nFor starters, when someone says they\u2019re interested in finding out more or getting involved in your group, don\u2019t just invite them to come to your next meeting and leave it at that. Even the most welcoming and inclusive groups tend to develop their own meeting culture that can unintentionally make new folks feel like outsiders. To increase your new member retention rates, schedule one-on-one intake interviews with new folks before they come to a group meeting. Get to know the person. Find out what attracted them to the group, what kinds of tasks they enjoy or are good at, and how much time they have. Then tell them more about the group and discuss what their involvement could look like. While this level of orientation requires more time up front, it saves time in the long run: people tend to plug into the work faster and stick around longer. It may make sense for one or two members of your group to take on this responsibility as an ongoing role.\nSecondly, if you want to inspire people to stay involved, you need to make them feel valued and appreciated. People like to be around people who treat them well. Most of us have no shortage of things we can do with a finite amount of free time: if you expect people to prioritize your group over aikido classes, contra dancing or advanced origami, you gotta treat \u2018em right. Notice and acknowledge new folks\u2019 contributions, however small. Make time to check in with them outside of meetings. Ask their opinions often: What did they think about the meeting? the event? the action? Bounce your ideas off of them and ask for their feedback.\n\nBy Jonathan Matthew Smucker","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/make-new-folks-welcome\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Make New Folks Welcome\/PR_Make New Folks Welcome_Declaration of Interdependence.jpg","links":[105009,100195,100148,200250,200237,200224,200189,200133,200270,200260,200187,300178,300261,400164,405156,200136,300201,400157,400256,400253,400265,400197,400167]},{"id":200220,"type":1,"title":"Lead with sympathetic characters","text":"Good actions tell a good story; good stories revolve around sympathetic characters.  Assembling a compelling cast of characters is a critical strategic consideration for any action designer. Actions tend to be strong on identifying and vilifying the antagonists of the narrative, but an audience will care much more about injustice if they can relate to the people who are being affected. Successful actions are often those that present strong protagonists and other sympathetic characters.\nThe role of the messenger who delivers the story of an action is key. Messengers embody the message by putting a human face on conflict and placing the action within a larger context. Those most impacted by the issue tend to make for more sympathetic and compelling messengers. For instance, if the action is about farm workers, it can be more effective to amplify the voices of a small group of farm workers who are taking action than to have a larger group of non-farm workers to speak up on their behalf. (Of course, solidarity actions certainly have their place: see CASE: Taco Bell boycott.)\nPower holders understand the importance of deploying sympathetic characters. For instance, welfare cuts get presented as benefiting working mothers, or corporate tax cuts sold as job-creation tools to help the unemployed. Time and again, the powerful play one group of sympathetic characters off another, or argue with Orwellian duplicity that the victims of a policy will actually benefit from it.\nIn these cases, a campaign becomes a contest over who gets to speak for those suffering. With whom do we sympathize, and are those characters actually given space to speak for themselves? A showdown results between messengers jockeying to represent themselves as the authentic representatives of the impacted constituencies.\nIn recent years, we have seen several uprisings against repressive governments framed explicitly around sympathetic characters. In Myanmar, monks became the new face of the pro-democracy movement, replacing the students of the 1988 mobilizations as the primary messengers. Obviously, many factions of society supported the movement, but with the monks at the front of the marches it was clear that the pro-democracy movement spoke for the conscience of the nation. Similarly, in Pakistan lawyers became the face of the fight against government impunity. Who better to embody the message of a need to respect the rule of law than lawyers?\nIt\u2019s important to ensure that the faces of the action are not just representative of the relevant impacted community, but also are easily recognizable to outsiders as key characters in the story. This can come down to the crude but important dynamics of costuming: a single religious leader wearing religious sacraments will communicate that people of faith are involved in the action better than twenty religious leaders wearing jeans and sweatshirts see PRINCIPLE: Don\u2019t dress like a protester.\n\nBy Doyle Canning and Patrick Reinsborough","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/lead-with-sympathetic-characters\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/doiley.jpg","links":[100207,100175,100226,201558,200526,200264,200241,200244,200233,100230,100184,100239,200232,200129,200249,200182,200183,200180,200130,200231,200131,300263,300142,300205,300201,300192,300209,300540,400196,400194,400157,400163,400254,404526,500308,500379,500364,500362,200211,400188,400251,400185,400252,400213,400267,400197,400168,400160]},{"id":200231,"type":1,"title":"Know your cultural terrain","text":"The first rule of guerrilla warfare is to know your terrain and use it to your advantage. This holds true whether you are fighting in an actual jungle or in the metaphoric wasteland of mass culture. Those of us engaged in creative activism need to be able to navigate the broader cultural landscape in which we wage our campaigns, and use it to our advantage. In the twenty-first century, this terrain includes viral video sensations, Twitter hashtags, guerrilla advertising, celebrity gossip, sports spectacles, religious iconography, and other cultural detritus.\nBut how is an activist supposed to survive, much less thrive, in a cultural environment created expressly for the purposes of commodifying everything of value or fostering obedience to authority?\nAll cultural artifacts contain contradictions. Marketing campaigns, for instance, are developed to exploit emotion in order to sell product, but to do this they need to tap into the deep-seated dreams and nightmares of large numbers of people. Sometimes these desires are scary and reactionary (brush with Pepsodent or you will die a spinster), but they also tap into positive, often Utopian dreams (drink this beer and you will be surrounded by a beloved, albeit tipsy, community).\nOr consider religion: progressive activists often think of religion as an institution designed to enforce the status quo. There\u2019s certainly much to condemn in religion, but it\u2019s also a system of ethics and a code of behavior that can be used to critique the norms and ideals of consumer capitalism. The world\u2019s great religions extol such virtues as love, community and responsibility for others \u2014 surely good material for an astute organizer to work with. Moses was a spectacular leader, Mohammed a master poet, and Jesus, chasing the money-changers out of the Temple and spinning engaging parables, was a crackerjack creative activist.\nIn 1906, the great philosopher, psychologist and pacifist William James told a group of American students that if they wanted to reach a wider public with their pacifist message, they needed to understand that war, no matter how bloody and barbaric, also tapped into worthy sentiments like honor and sacrifice, and that these values needed to first be recognized and then redirected. Instead of rejecting war outright, he concluded, the activists needed to articulate a \u201cmoral equivalent of war\u201d to take its place in the culture\u2019s value system. The trick, according to James\u2019 insight, is to tap into what\u2019s potentially positive in the surrounding culture and then redirect those dreams, desires, images and impulses into more progressive and creative social ends.\nToday\u2019s cultural terrain is multilayered and extremely varied. Unlike the guerrilla in the jungle, who pretty much only needs to know his own local terrain, we twenty-first century cultural guerrillas need to range far and wide. You may not like or be familiar with Nascar, professional sports, reality TV and superheroes, but they are all fertile arenas of culture to work with. It may take an open mind and a bit of personal courage, but it behooves us to immerse ourselves in, learn about and respect the world of the cultural \u201cOther\u201d \u2014 which, for many of us counter-culture types, ironically, is mass culture.\n\nBy Stephen Duncombe","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/know-your-cultural-terrain\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Know the cultural terrain and use it to your advantage\/PR_Know the Cultural Terrain_leahgun.jpg","links":[104127,100234,100177,100171,100226,100272,100218,100230,201558,200181,200264,200255,200223,200199,200249,200154,200220,100193,100239,200268,200182,200139,200158,200180,200130,200241,200183,300263,300178,300228,300201,300179,300243,400156,400210,400197,400144,400160,400165,404604,404749,500306,500310,500387,200219,300235,300142,300204,300205,300192,400170,400251,400253,400213,400265,400162,400166]},{"id":200211,"type":1,"title":"Kill them with kindness","text":"Kindness, smiles, gifts and unicorns (well, maybe not unicorns) can be potent weapons in the struggle against evil-doers.

Those who remain are given fake \u201cthis could have been a real ticket\u201d tickets warning them they\u2019re in violation of NYC parking rules.\nIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think that power will change its ways because of a sweet appeal or a considerate gesture or a paper airplane. But at the same time, it\u2019s a core element of nonviolent philosophy to recognize the humanity in everyone and seek to connect with it. The more we humanize politics, the more likely we are to win. The bureaucrat who secretly agrees with you is more likely to quit, and lend his skills to the revolution. The cop who\u2019s been given cupcakes and coffee by a Granny Against the War is that much closer to refusing an order to pepper spray a group of college students linking arms. The foreclosure auctioneer, touched by song, isn\u2019t going to slam that gavel down quite so hard the next time. And the public, witnessing all of these actions, is more likely to be moved to action themselves.

In July 2011, public frustration in Belarus over a deepening economic crisis reached a boiling point. The authoritarian regime of President Alexander Lukashenko had outlawed any political protest, and police were cracking down on any vocal expression of dissent. In response, organizers calling themselves \u201cRevolution Through Social Networks\u201d began calling on people to gather in public and clap their hands, or set their cell phones to ring all at once, thereby turning these simple everyday actions into profound public expressions of dissent.\nAs the non-protests spread, the police cracked down hard. The regime rightly recognized that the clapping was serving to undermine their authority. If they did nothing and continued to allow people to gather and clap without punishment, then the population could openly oppose the regime in other ways. Instead, the world saw the absurd sight of large numbers of Belarus citizens arrested for clapping. The crackdown exposed the government\u2019s deep irrationality, a perception only strengthened when it submitted to Parliament a bill to make \u201cthe organized inaction\u201d of silent protesters illegal.\nMany years earlier, in 1983, organized labor in Chile planned to kick off new resistance to the ten-year-old Pinochet dictatorship with a massive strike in the copper mines, the backbone of Chile\u2019s economy. Before the strike could occur, the mines were surrounded by the military and it seemed a bloodbath was certain to follow if the miners went through with this plan. Instead, the leadership brilliantly switched gears to a National Day of Protest made of decentralized actions, calling on those who supported them to drive slowly, turn their lights on and off at night, and at 8 pm to bang pots and pans. Many participated, and these mini-protests helped to rebuild the confidence of the brutalized opposition movement as people overcame their fear of acting.\nAs both of these actions dramatize, when mass gatherings and public protests become too dangerous, everyday actions can be used to signal dissent, gather crowds, get the word out, illustrate the ridiculous nature of repressive authority, and set up decision dilemmas, all the while avoiding or deferring violent repression see PRINCIPLE: Put your target in a decision dilemma.\nThis principle doesn\u2019t only apply to repressive third-world dictatorships, but to situations in supposedly more open societies where daily life has been criminalized for certain segments of the population.

They model it themselves. And they make sure that the expression of hardcore is designed to strengthen bonds between the group\u2019s core members and its broader political base. It should feel hardcore to the participants, and it should look like moral leadership to the political base and to a broader public.\n\nBy Jonathan Matthew Smucker","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/escalate-strategically\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Good Leaders Need to Define and Own Hardcore\/PR_Hardcore_SNCC Lewis and Zwerg.jpg","links":[105009,100191,100146,100175,100138,100143,100149,100128,100245,204970,200526,200222,200212,200237,200268,200131,200219,100240,200242,200137,200180,200227,200248,200190,200232,300178,300169,300209,300204,400168,400145,400265,400256,500326,200153,300243,300202,300205,300258,400172,400170,400188,400251,400185,400213,400167,400152]},{"id":200270,"type":1,"title":"Enable, don\u2019t command","text":"Supportive, enabling leaders awaken the creative potential of participants.

Why? Because your group isn\u2019t society. Sure, we should all try to be the change we want to see in the world see: PRINCIPLE. We should also think hard about who we are, what we\u2019re fighting for and why we\u2019re fighting for it. We should mull over the future society we want and how we can best model it in the here and now. We should even read books about it. But no matter how much we get absorbed in thinking about society, we should never mistake our activist groups for society.\nFor example, we want society to be democratic, but our bands cannot be models of the sort of democracy we\u2019re fighting for. Like families and rebel units, affinity groups aren\u2019t models for how society should be. Even a well-functioning, happy group may have unelected leaders. Decisions may be taken without fully consulting all members \u2014 or even any members. These would be odious practices if extended to society as a whole, but can be perfectly acceptable in a small group, where formal mechanisms are unnecessary because all members share a basic level of trust.\nWe obviously don\u2019t want society to be a place where everyone must fulfill their duty punctually and without complaint; we want real freedom, which is why turbo-capitalism is anathema to many of us. Yet to operate effectively, a small group may need to operate like an army battalion, or, more poetically, like the crew of a sailboat, with clear divisions of roles and responsibilities. And there may be dictators: while one or two people can\u2019t usually do all the work, it may be that one or two people must make all the decisions, especially in the heat of action, so that things happen quickly.\nIf you\u2019re in a group that works, at some point you may figure out the hidden interpersonal rules that enable the whole thing to crank along. Don\u2019t be appalled when you do. Those rules probably have nothing to do with democratic principles or consensus, but are based on intuitive navigation of face-to-face relationships. Often, whoever has the most energy simply makes things happen, and ends up making most of the decisions. Even when the starting model is consensus, the formal consensus process often gets jettisoned and the active members simply coordinate informally to get it all done. Why not take a shortcut and skip the formal consensus step, period?\nIf your group was working well and then ceases to, could it be that you\u2019ve complicated the decision making process through \u201copenness,\u201d and, to put it brutally, the wrong people have taken control?\nHOW THE OPPOSITE IS EQUALLY TRUE: This is a case in which the opposite is often equally true, especially in larger groups!

Better ideas, and often amazing creations, result. Brainstorm sessions should be a great way for groups to arrive at an idea that is better than an idea that an individual could have come up with alone, but they often don\u2019t work that way. In a big group, the ideas of a few people who feel confident enough to share their half-baked musings tend to drown out the rest. Yale researchers actually found that brainstorming can reduce a group\u2019s creativity. So when collectively designing an arts action, instead of brainstorming, try artstorming!\nWhen artstorming, instead of a blank wall where people write up ideas from the group, everyone stands up and starts improvising together with all the tools at hand. Instead of theorizing about what would look or sound good, they try it out. It starts with physical movement (proven to enhance creative output), then some form of improvisation (word association, or improv theater games) which prepares the brain to take risks.\nArtstorming is useful because it:\nMakes space for multiple intelligences and fluencies: Artstorming creates space for the spatially, kinesthetically and musically gifted folks who might be alienated from a verbal brainstorm.\nInvites people to be fully present: By engaging the full spectrum of our creative intelligence, artstorming taps into parts of us that might be snoozing most of the time. These parts will be badly needed in an arts action.\nSupports creativity: In an artstorm, people\u2019s honest expression of the feelings and ideas that brought the group together in the first place are safe to come out and play, so more expression happens.\nIs anti-capitalist: That\u2019s right. Hakim Bey asserts that under capitalism we have become increasingly alienated from our direct experiences with each other and with our art. Artstorming is an opportunity to reconnect with ourselves, our art, and each other.\nTo design an artstorm, begin with the simple question, \u201cWhat art could we use to effectively tell X message to Y audience to achieve Z result?\u201d (X, Y and Z are figured out prior). Use a brainstorm (not all brainstorms are bad) to list all of the different art media possible, including both visual and performance arts. Next, break up the room into groups that will artstorm using one to three media of their choice to develop their message. After ten minutes, have each group report back and give each other feedback so each can arrive at a focus for the next stage. Allow people to switch groups at this time if they\u2019d like. Now the real artstorm begins, focusing on a single idea from the first round with a group of people who all want to make it happen. Invite people to take turns experimenting, with minimal verbal feedback. Eventually, groups will hit on an idea that works and morph into a group-led process of artistic co-creation.\n\nBy Levana Saxon","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/dont-just-brainstorm-artstorm\/","links":[104800,100177,100174,100273,200223,200130,200268,200232,200180,200153,200158,300141,300140,500304,300246]},{"id":200129,"type":1,"title":"Don&#8217;t dress like a protester","text":"If you look like a stereotypical protester, it\u2019s easy for people to write you off.

Therefore, don\u2019t dress like a protester. People don\u2019t care about protesters. Oh, there go those silly protesters again. What are they protesting this time? Look: the police are hitting them over the head! Well, they must have done something to deserve it.\nIt\u2019s not quite that bad, but you get the idea. Based on what they see in the media, folks get a fairly fixed idea of what \u201cprotesters\u201d look like \u2014 and the stereotype doesn\u2019t usually lend itself to immediate sympathy for your cause. If you\u2019re planning a mass street action and want to reach out to people who may not already agree with you, think about how you can undermine their stereotypes about \u201cprotesters\u201d see PRINCIPLE: Use others\u2019 prejudices against them. Remember: protest is what you are doing; it is not your identity see THEORY: Political identity paradox.\nIf you want schoolteachers, seniors and office workers to get angry that a cop is hitting you over the head, dress like you\u2019re on your way over to their house for Sunday dinner. Make it easy for them to imagine themselves, or their kids, in your position.\nConsider the aura conveyed by what you wear, whether that\u2019s the civility and seriousness of civil rights marchers in suit and tie or the calculated absurdity of \u201cBillionaires\u201d in tuxedos. In all ten years that Billionaires for Bush see CASE protested in the streets, including in the midst of some running street battles with police, never did a single one of us get arrested. It undoubtedly helped that most of us were white, but it also helped that most of us were wearing tuxedos. In New York, we had a one-liner: \u201cNew York\u2019s Finest would never arrest New York\u2019s finest dressed.\u201d And it was true. They never did. Of course, the action you\u2019re involved in may not afford the luxury of tuxedos, or generally leave you a lot of room to not dress like a protester. It may require protective gear: bandannas or gas masks to protect from tear gas; heavy clothing or even shields to protect yourself from billy clubs and rubber bullets. Even then, creativity can show the human and beautiful side of dissent. At the Battle in Seattle, many blockades were works of art, and many blockaders were creatively costumed. Or consider the Masquerade Project in New York, decorating gas masks with multicolored sequins and feathers, or the Tute Bianche in Italy or the Pr\u00eat \u00e0 R\u00e9volter collective in Spain, or the \u201cBook Bloc\u201d in the UK, all of which wore creative yet protective protest gear into battle, thereby subverting the official media narrative that protesters are violent, scary and (worst of all!) humorless.\nOften the most effective protests are those that don\u2019t look like protests.

The right creative action (that you photograph or film yourself) can give them the excuse or materials they need. If you want media coverage of your event, give them a story they can\u2019t refuse: one that makes your point very clearly, with great visuals, an unexpected twist or a lot of humor. If a journalist already wants to cover an issue, this assist will give them the excuse or extra ammunition they need to sell their editor on it.\nDon\u2019t worry about squeezing all the relevant information into the stunt or hoax itself. If you can, great, but most of the key info can be conveyed via an accompanying press release. The action itself just needs to provide a hook or entry point by lifting the veil on a black-and-white situation and pointing out obvious but seldom discussed truths. If your action does this well, journalists will enjoy writing about it and public opinion (along with a well-orchestrated activist campaign) can do the rest.\nWhen the Yes Men announced that the Chamber of Commerce was supporting climate change legislation, or that Dow was going to accept its responsibility for Bhopal, or that General Electric was giving back its $3.2 billion tax credit, these were just funny actions pointing to simple, undeniable realities: the Chamber was mad to not support climate-change legislation, Dow should clean up Bhopal, GE should pay its taxes. Many journalists want to write about these obvious truths, but for editorial reasons, cannot. Creating a funny, spectacular action that\u2019s all about an issue allows them to cover it.\nMake the journalists\u2019 job as simple as possible. Provide them with what they need: a concise press release, photo with clear permissions, or a good video news release, replete with the facts, figures and soundbites that illustrate your point.\nIt\u2019s imperative to document your action yourself and make your photos and footage available. The glitter-bombing of Newt Gingrich see TACTIC: Creative disruption wouldn\u2019t have gone viral if there hadn\u2019t been an accomplice videotaping it. When Brad Newsham organizes human banners, he hires a helicopter and professional photographer to fly overhead, then passes those photos to interested media outlets that couldn\u2019t make it out there themselves.\nThe stealthier the action, the more important it is to document it yourself. Nobody but the organizers of flash mobs or guerrilla musicals know when and where they\u2019re going to occur, so you have to integrate photographers and videographers into those actions. But afterwards, don\u2019t just post your stuff on Flickr and YouTube and hope for the best. Instead, have a plan for getting those visuals out to the media. When Agit-Pop carried out the Public Option Annie guerrilla musical, they did a lightning edit of their footage immediately after the action and got it out to key outlets within the day\u2019s news cycle.

Delegate! One flaw of group work is that it\u2019s easy to walk out of a meeting with no assigned tasks, thinking \u201csomeone else is going to do that.\u201d Obviously, if everyone thinks that, nothing gets done. Just because the group comes to consensus on the need for something to get done doesn\u2019t mean anyone is necessarily going to do it. Things get done only when the task is clearly defined and on someone\u2019s to-do list.\nThis principle may sound simple and obvious, but you\u2019d be shocked how often we forget it.\nMake sure every group meeting has a note-taker who records all tasks and who\u2019s agreed to do them, and then emails or otherwise shares that task list with the whole group soon after the meeting (same day, if possible). To ensure effective follow-through, have people explicitly commit to their tasks in front of the group, and begin each meeting by reviewing the last meeting\u2019s task list.\nSome responsibilities are limited to a single action item, such as, \u201creserve a room for next week\u2019s meeting.\u201d But other responsibilities \u2014 say, \u201corganize a press conference\u201d \u2014 often involve a whole complex of tasks and the contributions of a number of people over many days. That\u2019s when you may need someone to \u201cbottom-line.\u201d A bottom-liner doesn\u2019t do everything herself, but takes responsibility for ensuring everything gets done. If people on her team don\u2019t come through, it\u2019s her responsibility to find someone else, triage, or do it herself. It doesn\u2019t ultimately matter how the job gets done, just that she is accountable to the larger group for ensuring that it does, or explaining why it didn\u2019t.\nProper delegation and sharing of tasks is also one of the best ways to prevent burn-out see PRINCIPLE: Pace yourself.\nRegardless of whether your group has a more vertical or horizontal leadership structure, delegation is key. Good leaders know how to delegate tasks, how to choose and support bottom-liners (some of the best people won\u2019t step up unless they\u2019re asked), and how to make sure everyone knows their role. Be explicit. People don\u2019t want vague responsibilities. They want to know what their role is and why it\u2019s important.\nVolunteer and grassroots groups often struggle with participants who commit to doing something but then never follow through. You have to factor that in upfront. Be careful when giving critical tasks to an untested volunteer. Here\u2019s the standard conversation one of the authors has with new volunteers:\n\u201cDo you know the most important word in a volunteer\u2019s vocabulary?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018No\u2019 is the most important word you can say. Use it. A lot. If you say \u2018yes I can do it\u2019 out of guilt or an over-enthusiasm that you can\u2019t follow through on, then we\u2019re screwed. I\u2019d much prefer a \u2018No.\u2019 Then we can assign the task to someone whose \u2018Yes\u2019 means yes.\u201d\nFar from being onerous, this is actually empowering \u2014 and honoring. You\u2019re saying: your work is valuable enough that we need to have a solid commitment and the specifics nailed down.

First identify your target audience and then brainstorm actions to effectively convey your message. A guerrilla musical performance of the latest Justin Bieber hit would be awesome \u2014 unless you\u2019re trying to influence the members of the American Association of Retired Persons.\nRemember that there is no right audience, just the audience that is right for your particular goals. Try this basic formula: we can get A to do B if they believe C. A is your audience, B is your objective and C is your message.

These values are more important than the form itself, which activists should modify as needed to uphold these values. Consensus decision making is an egalitarian and inclusive method of reaching agreement based on the active participation and consent of group members to collectively reach a decision. Consensus decision making focuses as much on the underlying processes and values as the decision itself. The word consensus has its roots in the Latin word consentire, meaning \u201cto experience or feel together.\u201d\nConsensus is rooted in many decentralized models of direct democracy practiced across the world \u2014 from village panchayats in India to the indigenous Haudenosaunee Confederacy (aka Iroquois), from Quaker meetings to anarchist spokescouncils.\nConsensus stands in stark contrast to simple voting procedures or Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, in which proposals are debated and then voted on, with majority rule. Consensus, on the other hand, is a prefigurative affirmation of our power to organize ourselves in accordance with the principles of direct democracy: horizontal, participatory, inclusive, cooperative and non-coercive. As author David Graeber has written of consensus, \u201cUltimately it aspires to reinvent daily life as whole.\u201d\nA common abuse of consensus, however, is a dogmatic attachment to the structures and forms with which it is associated, which can sometimes be as exclusive and alienating as the systems it seeks to replace. If this is happening, the response should not be \u201cWell this is how consensus works!\u201d Instead, it is our collective responsibility to delve into the dynamics that might be creating these negative reactions.\nThere are five common problems with consensus that can create frustration. First, consensus often reproduces majoritarian rule by creating sectarian camps of those in agreement versus those who are blocking. Contrary to popular belief, consensus does not necessarily mean unanimous agreement. This misconception causes us to wrongly view dissent as a distraction or obstacle, and increases the pressure toward homogenizing opinions. Second, a few voices can dominate the discussion, a problem that tends to perpetuate power imbalances around race, class, gender, and education level. Third, there is often a faulty assumption that silence implies consent, which can end up stifling broader discussion and the consideration of alternative proposals. Fourth, facilitators have an unfortunate tendency to exercise covert forms of power-over rather than power-with by steering the conversation based on their own biases.\nThe fifth problem with consensus is more fundamental and structural. Ironically, the seemingly benign notion that all voices are equal can hide the uncomfortable truth of systemic inequality. Almost inherently, the consensus process can absolve us of actively examining how privilege and oppression shape our spaces.\nIn an effort to address these problems, many communities and collectives use modified forms of consensus \u2014 for example, prioritizing and taking leadership from women, people of color and those directly affected by decisions being made; facilitating small break-out groups to ensure more engaged participation; encouraging more debate and discussion rather than just asking for blocks; and actively incorporating anti-oppression principles to prevent harmful opinions from further marginalizing historically disadvantaged peoples.\nConsensus can be beautiful and transformative, but only when the structures and processes are meeting the needs and desires of those engaging in it.

Since the early 2000s, the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP), a radical anti-poverty organization based in Toronto, Canada, has organized under the slogan \u201cFight to Win.\u201d It\u2019s a simple slogan packed with meaning: to win, you\u2019ve got to fight. But the point isn\u2019t to fight; the point is to win.\nAn organization run by and for the poor, OCAP has proven extremely effective in compelling politicians, welfare workers and employers to grant the concrete gains they seek. In one of many successful actions, for example, OCAP prevented a gas station from pumping gas until the employer came out with money owed to a former employee. Similarly, mass delegations by OCAP to welfare offices have led to the reinstatement of benefits for low-income members. OCAP has been effective because it recognizes that social change comes through struggle, which involves articulating clear demands and applying targeted pressure on those in power to comply with those demands.\nNothing is more demoralizing to folks who have put many long hours into a fun and creative action than to hear the target of the action say: \u201cI don\u2019t have the power to do that for you, even if I wanted to. The guy you want is next door.\u201d (And actually have that be a true statement rather than a blow-off line.) When we plan our actions and campaigns, we have to understand our targets and what makes them tick, taking care to focus on the person with the power to meet our demands: to sign the check, to introduce the legislation or to cancel the contract.\nNot every target is vulnerable in the same way. A blockade, occupation or creative disruption may be effective against one target but not against another. What works once may not work a second time. We need to figure out where our target is weakest, and where we are strongest. What actions can we take that are outside their experience?

Strategy involves identifying your group\u2019s power and then finding specific ways to concentrate it in order to achieve your goals.[1] Organizing a rally, for example, should never be thought of as a strategy. It\u2019s a tactic. Before you can identify appropriate tactics, you need to identify your target see PRINCIPLE: Choose your target wisely and figure out what power you can bring to bear against it.\nDeveloping a strategy requires:\n\u2022 analyzing the problem;\n\u2022 identifying your goal (formulation of demands);\n\u2022 \u0007understanding your target[2] \u2014 who holds the power to meet your demands;\n\u2022 \u0007identifying specific forms of power you have over your target and how to concentrate that power to maximal effect.\nIf your target is a city councilor whose vote you need in order to pass a living wage ordinance, tactics that concentrate your power must involve or influence voters in her district in some way.\nIf your target is a bank that is carrying out foreclosures, tactics that concentrate your power must involve or influence their customers or regulators.\nWithin that framework, tactics are specific activities that:\n\u2022 mobilize a specific type and amount of power;\n\u2022 are directed at a specific target;\n\u2022 are intended to achieve a specific objective.\nIn choosing a tactic you must always be able to answer the question: \u201cWhat is the power behind the tactic?\u201d In other words, how does the tactic give you leverage over your target?\nWe use tactics to demonstrate (or imply) a certain form of power. For example, when we carry out an action against a particular company, our underlying power is economic \u2014 it must cost them time or customers. That\u2019s why disruption matters. If we target an elected official, our underlying power is political \u2014 our tactic must cost them contributions or votes. (The power to \u201cembarrass\u201d is only effective if embarrassing your target costs them money or votes by making voters or donors question their moral legitimacy. Embarrassment in and of itself isn\u2019t a form of power.)\nIn community organizing, power can be broken down into two broad categories:\nStrategic power\nPower that is sufficiently strong to win the issue.\nTactical power\nPower that can move you along toward a goal and help you gain ground, but is itself not decisive.\nOnce we understand the forms of power we can deploy, we are ready to develop our campaign plan.\nA campaign is a series of tactics deployed over a specified period of time, each of which builds the strength of the organization and puts increasing pressure on the target until it gives in on your specific demands. A campaign is not a series of events on a common theme; it is a series of tactics, each one carefully selected for its power to ratchet up pressure on a target over time. All tactics are connected, and each one is chosen on the basis of how much work it requires to pull off and how much pressure it will bring to bear.\nA campaign is not endless; it has a beginning, middle and end. It ends, ideally, in a specific victory: people get something they wanted or needed, and\/or the target agrees to do something they previously refused to do.\n\n\n\t[1] The author wishes to acknowledge Midwest Academy and Northeast Action, both of whom assisted in developing the curriculum that this module is based on.\n &#x21A9;\n\t[2] Often it\u2019s important to identify \u201csecondary targets.\u201d These are individuals who have significant power over your target and over whom you may have more power than you have over your primary target (see CASE: Taco Bell Boycott). &#x21A9;\nBy Janice Fine","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/choose-tactics-that-support-your-strategy\/","links":[100146,100177,100148,100149,100245,200237,200271,200180,200137,200153,200238,200132,200268,200241,300204,300209,300205,300259,300263,400196,400172,400188,400265,400256,404749,300169,300202,400145]},{"id":200187,"type":1,"title":"Challenge patriarchy as you organize","text":"Like all other unjust and arbitrary systems of authority and power, patriarchy must be actively challenged in political organizing if we are to achieve collective liberation. Patriarchy is a system of unequal power relations that gives men privileges in all areas of our lives \u2014 social, economic, institutional, cultural, political, and spiritual \u2014 while women and gender non-conforming people are systemically disadvantaged. Feminism is not about \u201cman-hating\u201d; it is about transforming the socially constructed and hierarchical ideology of patriarchy. Since patriarchy pervades society, it is no surprise that it pervades social movements as well. So a commitment to feminist praxis that challenges the toxic impact of patriarchy in organizing efforts is essential to building inclusive movements.[1]\nGiven the urgency of confronting \u201cbig issues\u201d like corporate power, militarization and environmental destruction, patriarchy and sexism within our groups often remain unaddressed. Some male allies feel they are not capable of sexism; but simply believing in gender equality does not erase male privilege. If we want to challenge patriarchy, we must understand how our actions and assumptions are influenced by the prevalence of sexism in our consciousness and social relations.\nThere are five key ways in which sexism manifests itself in our social movements:\n1 Women face an uphill battle to prove their intelligence and commitment as political activists.\n2 Political meetings are dominated by male speakers and leaders, while secretarial work, cooking, childcare, and the emotional labor of supporting community well-being are largely borne by women. This gendered division of labor is a frequently reproduced patriarchal pattern.\n3 Women continue to be sexually objectified. Women of color and femme women in particular are fetishized, obscuring the dynamics of racism, fatphobia, ability and hetero-patriarchy behind \u201cpersonal preferences.\u201d\n4 Women are more likely to challenge men on sexist comments than men are. Given the particular socialization of women under patriarchy, seemingly minor comments or incidents can leave women and gender non-conforming people feeling humiliated, angry or upset; yet such comments are often dismissed as harmless. Women discussing sexism are often characterized as \u201cdivisive\u201d or \u201cover-reactive\u201d and women\u2019s concerns are belittled unless validated by other men. This highlights disrespect for women\u2019s voices in discussing their own oppression.\n5 Feminism is not seen as central to revolutionary or collective struggle; instead it is relegated to a special-interest issue. This results in the trivialization of women\u2019s issues, particularly violence against women and reproductive justice.\nTransforming gender roles is not about guilt or blame; it is about a lifelong learning process to effectively and humbly confront oppression. Some ways to build pro-feminist communities include: a shared division of labor; encouraging women\u2019s voices and leadership in non-tokenizing ways; respecting self-identification by using preferred names and pronouns; being pro-active in breaking the silence around sexual violence within broader society and activist communities; making our groups safe spaces in which to raise and address issues; and not marginalizing women\u2019s issues or placing the sole responsibility for fighting oppression on the oppressed.\nWe must also realize that we do not just want \u201cmore\u201d women\u2019s representation; rather, we must actively facilitate and highlight women\u2019s own analysis and experiences of capitalism and oppression, especially those of women of color. Though patriarchy affects women much more severely, it distorts the humanity of all genders and reduces our ability to be in kinship with one another. Smashing patriarchy is not just a collective responsibility \u2014 it is ultimately about personal and interpersonal growth and collective liberation.\n\n\n\t[1] This is an abridged version of a lengthier piece available on the Colours of Resistance website. &#x21A9;\nBy Harsha Walia","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/challenge-patriarchy-as-you-organize\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Challenge Patriarchy in Political Organizing\/PR_Challenge Patriarchy_comrades.jpg","links":[200260,200264,200232,200268,200269,200133,200136,100239,200154,200237,300246,300203,300214,400156,500340,500364,500329,300261]},{"id":200183,"type":1,"title":"Bring the issue home","text":"Creative activists can make an otherwise abstract, far-away issue relevant by making it personal, visceral and local. The destruction of a far-off rainforest. The carnage of war thousands of miles away. People care, but usually not enough to act on that concern, at least until they understand viscerally what\u2019s at stake. Here are a few ways to bring the issue home to people with creative visuals, powerful personal narratives and by highlighting localized costs.\nShow the human cost\nWhen the Iraq War was raging, mainstream media didn\u2019t show the stream of flag-draped caskets coming off planes or images of bombed buildings and dead Iraqis. Most Americans, with the exception of military families, didn\u2019t viscerally feel the war\u2019s impact. To bring the human cost of war home, Nancy Kricorian, a CODEPINK activist in New York City, stood outside her senator\u2019s office and arranged a row of shoes of all sizes tagged with the names of Iraqi civilians who had been killed, and asked passersby to \u201cwalk in their shoes.\u201d Her gesture was picked up and repeated across the country. In a similar spirit, veterans have met on the beach in Santa Monica, California, every Sunday since the start of the Iraq War, to set up a field of white crosses in neat rows across the beach \u2014 one for each soldier who has died. A powerful reminder of the human cost of war, at once intimate and horrific.\nMake it personal\nLos Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum was recently planning to expand its operations in the Peruvian Amazon jungle. Well-researched pleas to halt the drilling got nowhere. That all changed when a delegation of native Achuar people (who would have been displaced by the drilling, their ancestral lands ravaged) traveled to the U.S. to share their story. The issue shifted from stopping an oil project to defending the homes of these people. Occidental had to cancel the project, and the Achuar are pursuing legal claims against Occidental for environmental damage already done. Bringing forward the names, faces and stories of your far-away issue makes the consequences of inaction far more real and relevant.\nPut a price tag on it\nIf people don\u2019t connect to the human cost of an issue, reaching their pocketbooks is another route. In 2005, when the historic Steinbeck Library in Salinas, California, was threatened with closure due to drastic budget cuts, farm workers and peace advocates joined forces and held a twenty-four-hour read-in to keep the library open, drawing attention to the money spent on waging wars rather than other priorities. Before the read-in, few in Salinas cared enough about the Iraq war to protest it; twenty-four hours later, the entire community understood how the high price of occupation affected them. When the local consequences of global policies are highlighted, people\u2019s circle of concern often widens.\n\nBy Rae Abileah and Jodie Evans","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/bring-the-issue-home\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/walkinshoes.jpg","links":[100218,100186,200247,200154,200220,200231,100161,100198,100138,100207,100146,200241,300243,300287,300203,300263,400252,400196,500348,300204,400266,400160]},{"id":200139,"type":1,"title":"Brand or be branded","text":"Branding is one of the more misunderstood communication concepts, especially among anti-corporate activists, who can and should use branding to their advantage. Branding is a dirty word for many activists, but it really just means \u201cthe set of expectations, memories, stories, and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer\u2019s decision to choose one product or service over another.\u201d[1] If we take branding out of the realm of consumption and into the interplay of ideas in the public sphere, then we see that the tools of branding can be used for more than just selling soap.\nThree important points to keep in mind about branding:\nBranding isn\u2019t inherently \u201ccorporate.\u201d Branding is really nothing more than a set of proven principles for associating, in the collective imagination, a certain word, phrase or image with a set of emotions or ideas. There\u2019s nothing inherently capitalist about that. Corporations use branding because it works. Anti-corporate activists can use it, too.\nBranding can make the difference between success and failure. Every movement wants its message to be heard, but simply being right won\u2019t sell your ideas. The human mind needs to be persuaded.\nThere are copious examples of movements using branding effectively. In the \u201990s, for instance, an adherence to a certain aesthetic helped unify the Otpor! youth movement that swept Serbia and ousted Slobodan Milo\u0161evic.\nWhatever the context, if you craft your message for your intended audience, then that audience will want to know more. It\u2019s as simple as engaging people in a dialogue that appeals to them. If they feel you aren\u2019t talking to them, they\u2019ll ignore you \u2014 or worse, work against you.\nYou\u2019ll be branded whether you like it or not, so be proactive. Even conspicuously \u201cunbranded\u201d campaigns have a brand. Despite its efforts to avoid defining itself, the Occupy movement ended up with an effective brand when the \u201c99%\u201d meme organically emerged as the touchstone for people within and outside the movement.\nIf you decline to brand yourself, you leave an opening for other people \u2014 including enemies \u2014 to brand you instead. Operating within someone else\u2019s frame is always more difficult than operating within a frame that you yourself have set. Think of your group\u2019s brand as water spewing out of a hose. You can either leave the hose on the ground, or you can pick it up and direct its flow. Either way, the water continues to flow \u2014 and if you don\u2019t pick up the hose, someone else will!\nBranding is an opportunity to shape your message and ultimately use the power of that message, its meaning, and its delivery to win the war of ideas. There\u2019s no such thing as an unbranded campaign or movement \u2014 though there are plenty of examples of poorly branded ones. Brand or be branded.\n\n\n\t[1] Seth Godin, \u201cdefine: Brand,\u201d Seth\u2019s Blog, December 13, 2009, http:\/\/sethgodin.typepad.com\/seths_blog\/2009\/12\/define-brand.html.  &#x21A9;\nBy Cristian Fleming","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/brand-or-be-branded\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/unswoosh.jpg","links":[100177,200231,100195,100184,100226,200130,200180,200129,200134,200241,200182,200158,200237,200199,300192,300208,300263,300228,300201,400210,400170,400144,400197,404842,500294,500285,500335,500371,500040,500775,300235,300179]},{"id":200158,"type":1,"title":"Balance art and message","text":"Effective creative interventions require a judicious balance of art and message.

Art seeks to explore the deep questions. Politics demands a clear direction and message. That\u2019s a tough tension to manage.

Singing together builds emotional ties and harmonies \u2014 literally and figuratively. Song makes us feel powerful and united in a way nothing else can. During the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1989, the Estonian liberation movement used the country\u2019s traditional songs in resistance work. At one juncture, a full quarter of the country\u2019s population sang together in the streets, facing down Soviet tanks.\nConsider the power of Picasso\u2019s Guernica. A striking and visceral canvas painted in protest of the first aerial bombing of civilians, its aura as a global symbol of the senseless devastation of war was still strong enough seventy years later that the Bush Administration felt compelled to throw a cloth over a tapestry copy of it when Colin Powell spoke at the UN pushing for war with Iraq. Images from Guernica continue to resurface in anti-war marches the world over.\nAdvertising is the dominant art form of capitalism, as well as a science of messaging. In the late 1980\u2019s Gran Fury, an AIDS activist art collective see PRACTITIONERS, used the artistic and messaging power of graphics to bring the AIDS epidemic front and center and move a critical social conversation in a direction it had never gone before. Their \u201cKissing Doesn\u2019t Kill: Greed and Indifference Do\u201d bus ads featuring same- and mixed-sex couples kissing were not only explicit in their visual content, but beautiful, hip, emotive and evocative.\nArt invites us to think rather than telling us what to think. This is one of its great powers, and if you make your art accessible and beautiful enough, people will want to follow where the thought goes. And because they\u2019re deciding where to go with it, they\u2019ll more easily connect it to their own experience.\nThe right balance of art and message can move both hearts and minds. Striking this balance, however, can be difficult. Think about your audience and your goals. What do you want your art to achieve? Do you want to evoke sympathy? Provoke deep soul-searching on a given issue? Get people to call their Senator? Art can help you do all of these things, but only when art and message are in balance. You know you\u2019ve struck gold when you\u2019re able to say something so clearly that it hardly needs to be said at all, but is instead embodied in the way you say it.\n\nBy Kevin Buckland, Andrew Boyd and Nadine Bloch","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/balance-art-and-message\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Balance art and Message\/PR_Balance art and message_Art weapon.jpg","links":[100177,100195,100272,100218,100230,100198,200181,200223,200244,200130,200249,200231,200271,200139,100239,100193,100174,200131,200154,200129,200180,300192,300206,300243,300205,300208,400170,400159,400253,404526,404749,404842,500304,500299,500285,500335,500344,500354,500377,500387,500331,500360,300140,300141,300179,400164,400210,400151,400162,400267,400166,400144]},{"id":200126,"type":1,"title":"Anyone can act","text":"Don\u2019t worry about being a lousy actor \u2014 you\u2019re a great one.

Think: masked 16-year-olds holding a banner that says \u201cSMASH CAPITALISM AND EAT THE RICH.\u201d\nHave you seen the scene of the \u201cMalcolm X\u201d movie where an army of outraged people gather and stand in perfect formation, with perfect posture, outside a prison to demand the release of their friend? It was so badass! They were all wearing suits, they stood as one, and their discipline clearly communicated: we\u2019re mad as hell, we\u2019re right, you\u2019re wrong, and you\u2019re going to give us what we want.\nIntegrity gives deep meaning and moral force to anger. We should never come off as mad-for-the-sake-of-being-mad, but rather as reluctantly, genuinely angry in the face of outrageous circumstances. Rather than reacting, we respond. Rather than lashing out, we stand our ground.\nOf course, suppressing legitimate anger can be as debilitating as hair-trigger reactions. Parts of the Left have been held back because we are afraid to express or channel popular outrage. Unable to tap into large-scale disaffection, we remain marginal. By contrast, many youth movements self-marginalize precisely because their anger doesn\u2019t resonate. Find the sweet spot between the two.\n\nBy Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/principle\/anger-works-best-when-you-have-the-moral-high-ground\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/PRINCIPLE Anger works best when you have the moral high ground\/malcolmx_large.jpg","links":[100245,200181,200233,200211,200132,100161,100127,100173,100191,100240,200182,200222,200248,200224,200232,200227,200199,300202,300169,300209,300261,300204,400172,400266,400168,400152]},{"id":301240,"type":2,"title":"Dunbar&#8217;s number","text":"Dunbar\u2019s number refers to the approximate number of primary, care-based relationships people can maintain. The concept carries interesting implications for navigating the leap from organizing among friends to organizing under formal structures. Most of our day-to-day interactions involve either primary or secondary relationships. If you are my twice-a-week hiking buddy, we have a primary relationship based in mutual care and reciprocal obligation. If you are my insurance agent or my boss, we have a secondary relationship based in formal rules. The Dunbar\u2019s number concept posits that there is a limited number of primary relationships a person can manage.\nAnthropologist Robin Dunbar suggests that the average person can only maintain about 150 primary, I-care-you-care relationships. The simple reason for this is that we reach certain cognitive limits, and because there is simply not enough time for more without diffusing the quality of all relationships. Obviously, the number is fuzzy, because with changes in culture come changes in relationships, and because relationships themselves are difficult to define precisely because they are not quantifiable. But if we assume 150 as a hypothetical constant, variable across some range, then the range itself is a valid premise for a few conclusions.\nOne implication of Dunbar\u2019s number is that when we shift from primary to rule-mediated relationships, mutual care is replaced by structural suspicion. This shift is significant. By necessity, a boss, administrator or manager will tend to put systems and rules before care or service. Administrators and managers become the caretakers of impersonality, and that impersonality accrues power to itself over and against the caring individual.\nThis invariably leads to rules that are designed to serve management and disadvantage the managed. In common parlance, &#8220;the tail starts to wag the dog.&#8221; This dog-waggery leads to resentment towards administration and management, who in turn become defensive, setting up a power struggle in which the administration is already advantaged by the growing dependency of the administered.\nWhat does this have to do with consciously political actions? Well, every time a group of friends considers becoming a committee, we ought to exercise the precautionary principle. Our desire to get bigger, stronger and more efficient can blind us to the more formidable strength we risk losing by neglecting primary relationships.\nIn other words, if we currently spend 80 percent of our time managing secondary relationships, then we need to figure out how we can flip that to 80 percent of our time nurturing primary relationships. One of the reasons many of us feel powerless in the face of so many crises is that we\u2019re cut off from the social cohesion that can only happen in small, intimate groups.\nIt is not hyperbole to say, then, that management is the enemy of social cohesion, because it substitutes secondary (weak) bonds for primary (strong) ones. By strengthening primary bonds, we not only develop a greater capacity to take effective action on our own behalves; we also increase our capacity to creatively respond to the forces that seem so threatening now.\n\nBy Stan Goff","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/dunbars-number\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/TH_Dunbars-number_relationships-connections.png","links":[100239,100149,200270,200133,200135,300178,300201,300209,400253,500775]},{"id":300540,"type":2,"title":"Framing","text":"In the words of media researcher Charlotte Ryan, \u201cA frame is a thought organizer, highlighting certain events and facts as important, and rendering others invisible.\u201d Framing a message correctly can make or break an entire campaign. We are narrative animals, always using story to make sense of our world, and conceptual frames are key to this process. Frames, writes George Lakoff, \u201care the mental structures that allow human beings to understand reality \u2014 and sometimes to create what we take to be reality.\u201d\nWhether we\u2019re aware of them or not, frames are embedded in the ways we describe and understand the world, imposing a meaning that often benefits those with power. For example, when economists give the \u201ceconomic forecast,\u201d the analogy of economy-as-weather subtly steers us to think of capitalism as a force of nature, beyond human control. This framing benefits banks and corporations, as it obscures how they actually manipulate markets to their own advantage.\nFraming can be a useful tool not just for reinforcing power, but also for contesting it (see PRINCIPLE: Reframe). When framing an action or campaign, we must consider how the problem or conflict can be most compellingly portrayed so as to disrupt the dominant framing and replace it with a frame that benefits the movement\u2019s goals.\nSome questions to ask include: Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? What is the conflict and what is at stake? What hidden forces or new solutions must be revealed? What are our underlying values? Is there a unifying theme that can create a framing structure for our story?\nFor example, when workers are organizing for better benefits, rather than rally for \u201cpaid\u201d sick time, which implies people should be paid by their already oh-so-generous employers to be home sick, they may choose to rally for \u201cearned sick time,\u201d which implies that the workers have earned this benefit as compensation. The shift from \u201cpaid\u201d to \u201cearned\u201d creates an entirely different frame for understanding the issue.\nWhile proponents of the so-called \u201cStop and Frisk\u201d program in New York City call the practice of \u201cpolice stops\u201d a boon for \u201ccommunity safety\u201d that \u201csaves lives,\u201d opponents of the program focus their message using the frame of \u201cracial profiling,\u201d and say that the policy \u201ccriminalizes a whole race and community of people.\u201d They widen and at the same time focus the frame on revealing a narrative of racial injustice, effectively mobilizing a broad-based movement of people of color and allies against racism.\nAnother example: fossil fuel company-backed scientists call themselves \u201cclimate skeptics\u201d for a reason. What scientist worth his salt isn\u2019t skeptical? Isn\u2019t that part of the scientific method? Rather than go down the dead-end road of \u201cBut they\u2019re lying!,\u201d climate activists have been able to frame these voices as marginal using analogies like \u201ctobacco science\u201d and labeling them \u201cclimate deniers.\u201d A denier (as opposed to a liar) makes an active choice to refute a difficult truth that society has already accepted.\nWhen you engage in framing, you must be willing to accept that the facts of your case alone are not enough for you to win (see THEORY: Ethical spectacle). Framing is a struggle over meaning. As framing guru George Lakoff reminds us, \u201cTruth must be framed effectively to be seen at all.

Cultural hegemony is a term developed by Antonio Gramsci, activist, theorist, and founder of the Italian Communist party. Writing while imprisoned in a Fascist jail, Gramsci was concerned with how power works: how it is wielded by those in power and how it is won by those who want to change the system. The dominant idea at the time amongst Marxist radicals like himself was that in order to attain power you needed to seize the means of production and administration \u2014 that is, take over the factories and the state. But Gramsci recognized that this was not sufficient. In his youth, he had witnessed workers take over factories in Turin, only to hand them back within weeks because they were unsure what to do with the factories, or themselves. Gramsci had also observed the skill of the Catholic Church in exercising its power and retaining the population\u2019s allegiance. Gramsci realized that in order to create and maintain a new society, you also needed to create and maintain a new consciousness.\nThe repository of consciousness is culture. This includes both big-C Culture, culture in an aesthetic sense, and small-c culture, culture in an anthropological sense: the norms and mores and discourses that make up our everyday lives. Culture, in this sense, is what allows us to navigate our world, guiding our ideas of right and wrong, beautiful and ugly, just and unjust, possible and impossible. You may be able to seize a factory or storm a palace, but unless this material power is backed up by a culture that reinforces the notion that what you are doing is good and beautiful and just and possible, then any gains on the economic, military and political fronts are likely to be short-lived.\nThe power of cultural hegemony lies in its invisibility. Unlike a soldier with a gun or a political system backed up by a written constitution, culture resides within us. It doesn\u2019t seem \u201cpolitical,\u201d it\u2019s just what we like, or what we think is beautiful, or what feels comfortable. Wrapped in stories and images and figures of speech, culture is a politics that doesn\u2019t look like politics and is therefore a lot harder to notice, much less resist. When a culture becomes hegemonic, it becomes \u201ccommon sense\u201d for the majority of the population.\nNo culture, however, is completely hegemonic. Even under the most complete systems of control, there are pockets of what Gramsci, and later Hall, called \u201ccounter-hegemonic\u201d cultures: ways of thinking and doing that have revolutionary potential because they run counter to the dominant power. For Gramsci, these cultures might be located in traditional peasant beliefs or the shop-floor culture of industrial workers; for Hall they might be found in youth subcultures like Rastafarians and punks, and even in commercial entertainment. The activist\u2019s job, according to Hall, is to identify and exploit these cultural pockets, build a radical counter-culture within the shell of the old society, and wage the struggle for a new cultural hegemony.\nAn important caveat: Gramsci never believed that cultural power alone was enough. The fight for cultural hegemony had to be part of an overall strategy that also incorporated struggles for political and economic power.\n\nBy Stephen Duncombe","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/cultural-hegemony\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Cultural Hegemony\/TH_Cultural Hegemony_Gramsci.jpg","links":[100143,201558,200181,200264,200199,200249,200231,200136,200183,200158,100207,100177,100239,200132,300178,300203,300259,400188,404604,404842,500333,500340,300209,300201,300169,300142,300204,300246,300228,300214,400213,400267,400197]},{"id":300140,"type":2,"title":"Theater of the Oppressed","text":"Theater of the Oppressed provides tools for people to explore collective struggles, analyze their history and present circumstances, and then experiment with inventing a new future together \r\nthrough theater. Theater of the Oppressed is an arsenal of theater techniques and games that seeks to motivate people, restore true dialogue, and create space for participants to rehearse taking action. It begins with the idea that everyone has the capacity to act in the \u201ctheater\u201d of their own lives; everybody is at once an actor and a spectator. We are \u201cspect-actors!\u201d \u2014 a term which Boal coined.\nBoal points out that when we are simply passive audience members, we transfer our desire to take action onto the characters we identify with, and then find that desire satiated as the conflict resolves itself on stage, in films or in the news. Catharsis substitutes for action.\nBoal, following Brecht, calls this bourgeois theater, which functions to reproduce elite visions of the world and pacify spectators. He says bourgeois theater is \u201cfinished\u201d theater; the bourgeoisie already know what the world is like and so simply present it onstage.\nIn contrast to bourgeois theater, \u201cthe people\u201d do not yet know what their world will be like Their \u201cauthentic\u201d theater is therefore unfinished, and can provide space to rehearse different possible outcomes. As Boal says: \u201cOne knows how these experiments will begin but not how they will end, because the spectator is freed from his chains, finally acts, and becomes a protagonist.\u201d[1]\nTheater of the Oppressed encompasses many forms, including the following:\nImage theater (see TACTIC) invites spect-actors to form a tableau of frozen poses to capture a moment in time dramatizing an oppressive situation. The image then becomes a source of critical reflection, facilitated by various kinds of interventions: spect-actors may be asked to depict an ideal image of liberation from that oppression, and then a sequence of transition images required to reach it, or to reshape an image to show different perspectives.\n\nForum theater (see TACTIC) is a short play or scene that dramatizes a situation, with a terribly oppressive ending that spect-actors cannot be satisfied with. After an initial performance, it is shown again, however this time the spectators become spect-actors and can at any point yell \u201cfreeze\u201d and step on stage to replace the protagonist(s) and take the situation in different directions. Theater thus becomes rehearsal for real-world action.\nLegislative theater takes forum theater to the government and asks spect-actors to not only attempt interventions on stage, but to write down the successful interventions into suggestions for legislation and hand them in to the elected officials in the room.\nInvisible theater (see TACTIC)\u00a0is a play that masquerades as reality, performed in a public space. The objective is to unsettle passive social relations and spark critical dialogue among the spect-actors, who never learn that they are part of a play. Augusto Boal said of one invisible theater intervention, \u201cThe actor became the spectator of the spectator who had become an actor, so the fiction and reality were overlapping.\u201d[2]\nA final point that perhaps can\u2019t be stated enough: our movements need to be more strategic and community-led! Theater of the Oppressed offers arts-based strategy-developing exercises that foster collaboration and community-led engagement.

The answer, according to Bey, lies in refusing to wait for a revolutionary moment, and instead create spaces of freedom in the immediate present whilst avoiding direct confrontation with the state.\nA T.A.Z. is a liberated area \u201cof land, time or imagination\u201d where one can be for something, not just against, and where new ways of being human together can be explored and experimented with. Locating itself in the cracks and fault lines in the global grid of control and alienation, a T.A.Z. is an eruption of free culture where life is experienced at maximum intensity. It should feel like an exceptional party where for a brief moment our desires are made manifest and we all become the creators of the art of everyday life.\nThe key, suggests Bey, is to remain mobile, relying on stealth and the ability to melt into the darkness at a moment\u2019s notice. Before the T.A.Z is spotted and recognized by the state, which will inevitably seek to crush it, it dissolves and moves on, reappearing in unexpected places to celebrate once again the wonders of conviviality and life outside the law. It might last hours, days, years even, depending on how quickly it is noticed by authorities.\nBey claims that T.A.Z.s have always existed. He sees their ancestry in the numerous liberated zones that pepper history: from the secret \u201cstate\u201d of the medieval Persian Assassins to the eighteenth century pirate utopias \u2014 islands where buccaneers, escaped slaves and convicts lived outside the law, sharing goods and property. From the radical communes of Paris and Munich to the dissatisfied colonizers of North America who deserted their enclave to join Native American communities, leaving the infamous sign behind them, \u201cGone to Croatan.\u201d\nBey maintains, however, that the T.A.Z. cannot be defined; it is simply a \u201csuggestion\u2026a poetic fancy,\u201d not \u201cpolitical dogma,\u201d and that \u201cif the phrase became current it would be understood without difficulty\u2026understood in action.\u201d Twenty years on, the notion of T.A.Z has inspired movements and actions across the world, from the creative play of Reclaim the Streets parties see CASE to the autonomy of protest encampments, the Anonymous hacker movement to the Burning Man festival and secret rainbow gatherings.\nWhen Bey first came up with the concept, the web was in its infancy, yet he already imagined a future world where a multitude of autonomous zones could be linked by dispersed networks of communication freed from political control. The web would not be an end in itself, he wrote, but a weapon without which autonomous zones would perish. At the time, he dismissed his own theory as pure speculative science fiction, but the future always arrives faster than one can imagine.\nMOST FAMOUS APPLICATION: If we wrote it down here the authorities would soon learn about it and it would have to dissolve. Keep your senses open; the nearest T.A.Z. is nearer than you think.\nIMPORTANT BUT LITTLE-KNOWN APPLICATION: The 1920\u201324 free state of Fiume (now the city of Rijeka, Croatia), whose constitution was written by poets and anarchists.\n\nBy John Jordan","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/temporary-autonomous-zone\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Temproary Autonomous Zone\/TH_Temporary Autonamous Zone_Burning Man.jpg","links":[100239,100146,200219,200271,100193,200158,200260,300209,300178,300176,300204,400236,400253,400251,400185]},{"id":300209,"type":2,"title":"The tactics of everyday life","text":"Tactics are not a subset of strategy, but a democratic response to it. Strategy and tactics, as the concepts are commonly understood, have their roots in military theory. The French Jesuit scholar Michel de Certeau, however, drew a distinction between the two terms that leaps over some of the martial history of these ideas.\nIn military parlance, strategy is the identification of key campaigns that are necessary to accomplish the main objective \u2014 in most cases, winning the war. Operations are the level of planning that determines key battles necessary to win campaigns. Tactics are those techniques that are required to win battles. So the tactic is subordinate to the campaign, which is subordinate to the strategy. Those who adapt the model inherit the hierarchy in which it is based.\nDe Certeau took a different approach, positing tactics not as subordinate to strategy but as opposed to it. He wrote about people in their everyday lives, not in conditions of extremity and conflict, in a book fittingly entitled The Practice of Everyday Life (1984).\nThe setting of strategy, notes de Certeau, is always the purview of power. Strategy presumes control. Strategy is self-segregating, in the same way administration and management are self-segregating, setting itself up as a barricaded insider. The strategic leaders become the Subject; the led and the enemy become the Objects. Strategy presumes an in-group that carries out campaigns.\nIn contrast to strategy, de Certeau characterizes tactics as the purview of the non-powerful. He understands tactics not as a subset of strategy, but as an adaptation to the environment, which has been created by the strategies of the powerful. The city planning commission may determine what streets there will be, but the local cabbie will figure out how best to navigate the lived reality of those streets. This art of making-do is what de Certeau calls bricolage, a process that often implies cooperation as much as competition.\nStrategy, de Certeau recognizes, makes two presumptions: control and an in-group. The inherent contradiction of strategy is that the control is never perfect and the situation upon which the strategy was constructed is always changing, which constantly makes aspects of the strategy obsolescent. The self-segregation of in-groups magnifies these myopic aspects of strategy, because the walls that keep others out also obscure their vision. Strategy becomes dangerously self-referential.\nTactics, on the other hand, are action in a constant state of reassessment and correction, based directly on observations of the actual environment. Tactical theorist John Boyd rather schematically diagrammed this process as an \u201cOODA-loop,\u201d in which people observe their surroundings (O), orient on the most important developments in the environment (O), decide on an immediate course of action (D), take that action (A), then revert immediately to observation of the environment to see how their last action might have changed it (orienting again, deciding again, acting again, in a perpetual adaptive loop). There is no presumption of how things will turn out, as there is in strategy. Instead, there is readiness to take advantage of unpredictable changes; this is called tactical agility, and it is often what sets popular uprisings apart from the institutions they seek to overthrow: they have strategy, we have tactics.\nStrategies are undermined by unpredictability. Tactics make an ally of unpredictability.\n\nBy Stan Goff","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/the-tactics-of-everyday-life\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORYTactics of Everyday Life\/TH_Tactics of Everyday Life_Football.jpg","links":[105009,100191,100173,100234,100193,100127,100143,100148,200526,200225,200223,200247,200229,200199,200268,200220,200242,200132,200136,200153,200190,301240,300141,100161,100226,100175,200238,200232,200237,300204,300259,300169,300243,400152,400251,400145,400196,300201,300202,300192,400170,400210,400159,400253,400197]},{"id":300235,"type":2,"title":"Society of the spectacle","text":"Modern capitalism upholds social control through the spectacle, the use of mass communications to turn us into consumers and passive spectators of our own lives, history and power. \u201cIn societies dominated by modern conditions of production, life is presented as an immense accumulation of spectacles,\u201d Guy Debord\u2019s Society of the Spectacle (1967) begins. \u201cEverything that was directly lived has receded into a representation.\u201d The political consequence of this separation from felt experience is key to understanding both how we experience the world and how we can change it.\nFor example, consider how people who witness a catastrophic event often say the experience was \u201clike a movie.\u201d Similarly, as activists we are often more concerned with the media attention our actions generate than with their end result.

This is the society of the spectacle that Debord, a leading figure in the French Situationist movement, described and decried.\nMarx famously argued that under capitalism, the commodity becomes \u201cfetishized\u201d and reduced to its exchange value. Debord applied Marx\u2019s ideas to mass communication, showing how capitalism has penetrated not just what we produce and consume, but how we communicate.

This is control by seduction and distraction, not force \u2014 but no less powerful and insidious for that fact. Debord argued that our lives have been degraded, first from being into having, then from having into merely appearing.

But that\u2019s precisely what the Serbian student movement Otpor was able to achieve when it transformed a previously passive and fatalistic citizenry into the nonviolent army that overthrew Slobodan Milo\u0161evic\u0107, the \u201cButcher of the Balkans,\u201d in 2000.\nAs Rosenberg explains in her book, \u201cTraditional democracy activists create political parties. Otpor created a party. People joined the movement for the same reasons they go to the hot bar of the moment.\u201d By branding itself with hip slogans, black t-shirts, absurd humor, rock music and an iconic clenched-fist graphic, the eleven founders of Otpor \u2014 all university students at the time \u2014 reinvented resistance in Serbia by making it a desirable club to join.\nThey even managed to create a cult around getting arrested. For teenage boys, it was a way to be rebellious and win the respect of girls at the same time. Eventually, getting arrested became a competition and kids would compete to rack up the most busts. As one Otpor member noted, \u201cWhen someone asks me who took down Milo\u0161evic\u0107, I say, \u2018High school kids.\u2019 \u201d\nBy appealing to people\u2019s need, not just for information but for identification, Otpor showed that the social cure can be used in even the most difficult and repressive of situations as a force for rallying citizen power. Put more simply, in the words of Otpor founder Srdja Popovic, \u201cTheir language smelled like death.

The shock doctrine is a theory for explaining the way that force, stealth and crisis are used in implementing neoliberal economic policies such as privatization, deregulation and cuts to social services. Author Naomi Klein advanced this theory in her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.\nBy way of metaphor, Klein recounts the history of electroshock therapy experiments conducted by Scottish psychiatrist Ewen Cameron for the CIA in the 1950s. Cameron\u2019s \u201cshock therapy\u201d sought to return troubled patients to a blank slate on which he could write a new personality. Klein argues that a parallel \u201cshock therapy\u201d process has been used at the macro level to impose neoliberal economic policies in countries around the world.\nThe shock doctrine posits that in periods of disorientation following wars, coups, natural disasters and economic panics, pro-corporate reformers aggressively push through unpopular \u201cfree market\u201d measures. For more than thirty years, Klein writes, followers of Milton Friedman and other market fundamentalists have been \u201cperfecting this very strategy: waiting for a major crisis, then selling off pieces of the state to private players while citizens were still reeling from the shock, then quickly making the \u2018reforms\u2019 permanent.\u201d\nOne of the earliest examples of the shock doctrine is the case of Chile. In 1973, Chile\u2019s democratically elected socialist President Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat led by army general Augusto Pinochet, with support from the United States. Amid lingering turmoil created by the coup and tensions caused by the ensuing economic downturn, Milton Friedman suggested that Pinochet implement a \u201cshock program\u201d of sweeping reforms including privatization of state-owned industries, elimination of trade barriers, and cuts to government spending. To implement these policies, the Pinochet regime appointed to important positions several Chilean disciples of Friedman. Additionally, to squash popular movements that opposed these changes, the regime unleashed a notorious program of torture and \u201cdisappearances,\u201d which ultimately led to the deaths of thousands of dissidents.\nKlein contends that various forms of the shock doctrine have since been used to advance hyper-capitalist reforms, for example in former Eastern Bloc countries following the collapse of the Soviet Union and in South Africa after the end of apartheid. More recently, pro-corporate advocates have used the 2004 tsunami in south Asia to privatize public beaches in Sri Lanka and have worked to slash corporate taxes and public education and re-shape neighborhoods in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In each case we witness, in Klein\u2019s words, \u201corchestrated raids on the public sphere in the wake of catastrophic events, combined with the treatment of disasters as exciting market opportunities.\u201d\nAlthough the shock doctrine has helped explain neoliberal attempts to take advantage of disaster situations, it cannot entirely account for the success of \u201cfree market\u201d ideology, particularly in cases in which the market\u2019s powers of seduction play a larger role than the use of brute force. Moreover, we should remember that neoliberals are not the only ones who can capitalize on a crisis. Throughout the world, social movements are learning that political upheaval and economic downturn can create opportunities for popular movements to demand, and construct, a more just and equitable society.\nMOST FAMOUS APPLICATION: Chile under Pinochet (1973-1989); post-Soviet Russia; post-tsunami Sri Lanka; post-Katrina New Orleans.\n\nBy Mark Engler","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/the-shock-doctrine\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/shock_doctrine_US_hardcover.preview.jpg","links":[100138,300200,300176,300214,300204,400188,300203]},{"id":300169,"type":2,"title":"Revolutionary nonviolence","text":"Revolutionary nonviolence emphasizes unity among radicals and proposes a militant nonviolent praxis based on revolutionary transformation and mass civil resistance. For activists working for radical change, there is a useful distinction to be made between Gandhian, strategic and revolutionary nonviolence. Gandhian nonviolence is a combination of constructive, base-building programs and satyagraha, often interpreted in the Global North as a form of spiritual direct action. Strategic nonviolence see TACTIC takes a more tactical tack and focuses on the tactics enumerated by Gene Sharp. Meanwhile, as Gandhi himself noted, revolutionary nonviolence suggests that it is better to engage in violence than to do nothing in the face of oppression[1], and that any popular movement must push beyond mere reformist change that leaves structures of oppression intact, even though this requires active confrontation.\nIndian activist Jayaprakash (JP) Narayan made important advances in this line of thinking, calling for \u201ctotal revolution\u201d in a framework that included anti-authoritarianism, non-orthodox Marxism and self-determination for all peoples. As a campaigner at the time of the Chinese communist revolution, JP\u2019s main critique of Mao Zedong\u2019s maxim that \u201cpower grows out of the barrel of a gun\u201d was the simple observation that those with the most destructive weapons were never the masses of the population, but rather those with the most entrenched power and authority. JP suggested that Mao\u2019s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (at least in its core intentions) bore striking similarities to satyagraha, in that both were meant to combat a profit-motivated mentality, and both sought to disarm the exploiting classes.\nThe greatest successes of the Chinese and Vietnamese strategy of people\u2019s war \u2014 which calls for mobile tactics and the creation of clandestine fighting units \u2014 often lay in the implementation of popular education programs, the creation of self-sufficient economic units and the formation of mass-based organizations. The military successes were more ambiguous. Even in the heat of battle, some of the leaders of Africa\u2019s liberation wars, most notably Am\u00edlcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau, commanded his followers to be \u201cmilitants, not militarists.\u201d The widely repeated South African dictum that \u201cnonviolence just didn\u2019t work\u201d in the ultra-repressive context of the racist apartheid regime has been refuted in post-apartheid society, as even organizers of the armed struggle now openly question the ways in which authoritarian styles grew out of their military structures.\nIn the U.S. context, mainstream academics are beginning to discuss what many African American activists have quietly understood for decades: that the ideological and tactical differences between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Minister Malcolm X were never as contradictory or divergent as the popular narrative would have us believe. As each developed and matured, their analyses of the nature of the U.S. state, and the variety of approaches needed to resist it, increasingly converged.\nThe theory of revolutionary nonviolence demands a nuanced view of struggle, one that does not over-emphasize the dichotomy between nonviolent and armed revolutionaries \u2014 that neither celebrates passivity nor fetishizes confrontation. It embraces the contributions of Archbishop Desmond Tutu\u2019s Ubuntu philosophy: the notion that everyone\u2019s liberation is indelibly connected. Advocates of revolutionary nonviolence must include an adherence to strategic nonviolence, but also must maintain dialogues well beyond those who agree with that framework.\n\n\n\t[1] \u201cIt is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts,\u201d Gandhi said, \u201cthan to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.\u201d Mahadev Desai, Day-to-Day with Gandhi (Secretary\u2019s Diary) Vol. ll (Rajghat, India: Sarva Seva Sangh Prakashan, 1968), p. 175.

The model suggests that media outlets will consistently produce news content that aligns with the interests of political and economic elites. The propaganda model seeks to explain media behavior by examining the institutional pressures that constrain and influence news content within a profit-driven system. In contrast to liberal theories that argue that journalism is adversarial to established power, the propaganda model predicts that corporate-owned news media will consistently produce news content that serves the interests of established power.\nFirst introduced in 1988 in Edward S. Herman\u2019s and Noam Chomsky\u2019s Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, the propaganda model argues that \u201cthe raw material of news\u201d passes through five filters that ultimately shape the news audiences receive. These filters determine what events are deemed newsworthy, how they are covered, where they are placed within the media and how much coverage they receive.\nThe five filters are as follows:\nConcentrated ownership, owner wealth and profit-orientation of the dominant mass-media firms. Corporate media firms share common interests with other sectors of the economy, and therefore have a real stake in maintaining an economic and political climate that is conducive to their profitability. They are unlikely to be critical of economic or political policies that directly benefit them.\nAdvertising as primary source of income. To remain profitable, most media rely on advertising dollars for the bulk of their revenue. It is therefore against the interests of the news media to produce content that might antagonize advertisers.\nReliance on information provided by \u201cexpert\u201d and official sources. Elites have the resources to routinely \u201cfacilitate\u201d the news-gathering process by providing photo-ops, news conferences, press releases, think-tank reports and canned news pieces that take advantage of the news media\u2019s need for continuous and cheap news content. Business leaders, politicians and government officials are also typically viewed as credible and unbiased sources of information, jettisoning the need for fact-checking or other costly background research. This filter was clearly demonstrated during the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, when the U.S. news media took official pronouncements at face value, refusing to investigate their veracity or accuracy.\nFlak as a means of disciplining the media. Flak refers to negative commentary to a news story that can work to police and discipline journalists or news organizations that stray too far outside the consensus. Flak includes complaints, lawsuits, petitions or government sanctions.\nAn external enemy or threat. Manifesting as \u201canti-communism\u201d during the Cold War period when Manufacturing Consent was originally published, this filter still operates, particularly in the post-9\/11 political climate. This filter mobilizes the population against a common enemy (terrorism, energy insecurity, Iran\u2026) while demonizing opponents of state policy as insufficiently patriotic or in league with the enemy.\nThe propaganda model suggests that corporate media ultimately serve to \u201cmanufacture consent\u201d for a narrow range of self-serving \u00e9litist policy options. It allows us to understand the institutional pressures that ultimately color how activists\u2019 causes and actions are covered. By understanding the limits of \u201cobjectivity\u201d and the contradictions within corporate-sponsored journalism, we can develop media tactics that take advantage of these contradictions while also bypassing the filters of the corporate press, and directly appealing to the public through alternative forms of media. As Herman himself suggests, \u201cwe would like to think that the propaganda model can help activists understand where they might best deploy their efforts to influence mainstream media coverage of issues.\u201d[1]\n\n\n\t[1] Edward S.

Balancing these two tendencies is crucial to sustaining the work of an effective group, organization or movement. Any serious social movement needs a correspondingly serious group identity that encourages a core of members to contribute an exceptional level of commitment, sacrifice and heroics over the course of prolonged struggle. Strong group identity, however, is a double-edged sword. The stronger the identity and cohesion of the group, the more likely people are to become alienated from other groups, and from society. This is the political identity paradox.\nThe political identity paradox suggests that while political groups require a strong internal identity to foster the commitment needed for effective political struggle, this same cohesion tends to isolate the group. Isolated groups are hard-pressed to achieve political goals.\nThis is true of all groups, but tends to have particular consequences for a group involved in political struggle, which has not only to foster a strong internal identity: it also has to win allies.\nThe tendency toward isolation can escalate very quickly in political groups, as oppositional struggle can foster an oppositional psychology. Activists who meet the kind of brutal resistance that the civil rights movement endured, for example, have a tough row to hoe. On the one hand, participants need to turn to each other more than ever for strength and support. They feel a compelling cohesiveness to their group identity in these moments of escalated conflict. On the other hand, they need to keep outwardly oriented, to stay connected to a broad and growing base. This is difficult to do even when leaders are fully oriented to the task, let alone when they are unprepared, which is often the case.\nTake, for example, Students for a Democratic Society (the original SDS that fell apart in dramatic fashion in 1969). At the center of the epic implosion of this massive student organization \u2014 beneath the rational arguments that leaders were slinging at each other \u2014 was the political identity paradox. Key leaders had become encapsulated in their oppositional identity and grown more and more out of touch. They lost the ability and inclination to relate to their broader membership \u2014 a huge number of students at the moment of the implosion \u2014 let alone to broader society. Some of the most committed would-be leaders of that generation came to see more value in holing up with a few comrades to make bombs than in organizing masses of students to take coordinated action.\nThis is the tendency toward isolation taken to the extreme. Dedicated radicals cut themselves off, like lone guerrilla fighters in enemy territory. It might have felt glorious, but it was a suicide mission.\nThe political identity paradox speaks to the need for political groups to develop both strong bonding and strong bridging. Without strong within-group bonding, group members will lack the level of commitment required for serious struggles. But without strong beyond-group bridging, the group will become too insular and isolated to forge broad alliances.\nGood leaders have to perform an extraordinary balancing act between the conflicting imperatives of building a strong sense of identity within their groups and connecting with allies and potential allies beyond the group see PRINCIPLE: Escalate strategically for ideas on how to strike this balance.\n\nBy Jonathan Matthew Smucker","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/political-identity-paradox\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Political Identity Paradox\/TH_Political identity paradox_Weather.jpg","links":[100234,201558,200189,200269,200231,200132,200129,301240,300243,300141,300201,200224,200212,200180,200270,200136,404842,300205]},{"id":300204,"type":2,"title":"Points of intervention","text":"A point of intervention is a physical or conceptual place within a system where pressure can be put to disrupt its smooth functioning and push for change. Points of intervention are specific places in a system where a targeted action can effectively interrupt the functioning of a system and open the way to change. By understanding these different points, organizers can develop a strategy that identifies the best places to intervene in order to have the greatest impact.\nSocial movements have traditionally intervened by taking direct action at physical points in the systems that shape our lives, but with the spread of effective labor organizing and the increasing power of media, conceptual points of intervention have become increasingly important.\nTruly effective interventions go beyond simply disrupting a system to pose a deeper challenge to its underlying assumptions and basic legitimacy. This holds true whether the intervention targets a physical system like a sweatshop or an ideological system like racism, sexism, or market fundamentalism.\nThe five types of points of intervention are points of production (for instance, a factory), points of destruction (a logging road), points of consumption (a retail store), points of decision (a corporate headquarters) and points of assumption (a foundational narrative or a place of symbolic importance).\nPoint of production\nAction at the point of production is the foundational insight of the labor movement. Workers organize to target the economic system where it directly affects them, and where that system is most vulnerable. Strikes, picket lines, work slowdowns, and factory take-overs are all point-of-production actions.\nPoint of destruction\nA point of destruction is the place where harm or injustice is actually occurring. It could be the place where resources are being extracted (a strip mine) or the place where the waste from the point of production is dumped (a land-fill). By design, the point of destruction is almost always far from public attention \u2014 made invisible by remoteness, oppressive assumptions, or ignorance \u2014 and tends to disproportionately impact already marginalized communities. Intervention at the point of destruction can halt an act of destruction in the moment, as well as dramatize the larger conflict.\nPoint of consumption\nThe point of consumption is the location of interaction with a product or service that is linked to injustice. Point-of-consumption actions are the traditional arena of consumer boycotts and storefront demonstrations. The point of consumption is often the most visible point of intervention for actions targeting commercial entities. Point-of-consumption actions can also be a good way to get the attention of corporations when lawmakers aren\u2019t listening.\nPoint of decision\nThe point of decision, where the power to act on a campaign\u2019s demands rests, is often the most self-evident point of intervention, and therefore one of the most frequently targeted. Whether it\u2019s a slumlord\u2019s office see CASE: Day care center sit-in, a corporate boardroom or state capital, or an international summit meeting see CASE: Battle in Seattle, many successful campaigns have used some form of action at the point of decision to put pressure on key decision-makers.\nPoint of assumption\nAssumptions are the building blocks of ideology, the DNA of political belief systems. They operate best when they remain unexamined. If basic assumptions can be exposed as contrary to people\u2019s lived experience or core values, entire belief systems can be shifted. Actions that expose and target widely held assumptions see CASE: Billionaires for Bush and CASE: Barbie Liberation Organization can therefore be very effective at shifting the discourse around an issue and opening up new political space. Point-of-assumption actions can take many different forms, such as exposing hypocrisy, reframing the issue, amplifying the voices of previously silenced characters in the story, or offering an alternative vision see TACTIC: Prefigurative intervention.\nTurning creative action into real change requires careful strategizing. Identifying different possible points to target is a great first step to help design actions that connect to large campaign and social change goals.\n\nBy Patrick Reinsborough and Doyle Canning","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/points-of-intervention\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Points of Intervention\/TH_Points of Intervention_grassy narrows.jpg","links":[100239,100191,100173,100146,100184,100234,100177,100171,100240,100226,100127,100272,100143,100218,100148,100149,100128,100245,100150,100186,100161,200222,200248,200255,200223,200227,200237,200238,200249,200268,200131,200154,200219,200132,200137,200153,200190,300141,300209,300257,300169,200182,200231,200244,200241,200183,300259,300263,300287,300208,300243,300214,400156,400254,400196,400166,400152,400145,400265,400144,400256,405098,500320,500366,300203,300176,300262,300258,400172,400170,400188,400159,400157,400252,400253,400197,400168,400160]},{"id":300259,"type":2,"title":"Pillars of support","text":"Power stems not just from a ruler\u2019s ability to use force, but from the consent and cooperation of the ruled, which can be voluntarily and nonviolently withdrawn by identifying, targeting and undermining the ruler\u2019s \u201cpillars of support\u201d \u2014 the institutions and organizations that sustain its power.   Conventional wisdom tells us that power resides in the hands of those at the top, and that when push comes to shove, \u201cpower grows out of the barrel of a gun,\u201d as Mao famously said. If so, then the only way to defeat a violent opponent is through the use of even greater violence.\nAt the root of all nonviolent action, however, is a different understanding of the nature of power \u2014 one that flips this conventional wisdom on its head. This understanding posits that power is ultimately dependent on the cooperation and obedience of large numbers of people acting through the institutions that constitute the state. These are its pillars of support.\nSome of these pillars, such as the military, the police and the courts, are coercive in nature, compelling obedience through force or the threat thereof, while other pillars, like the media, education system and religious institutions, support the system through their influence over culture and popular opinion. Hence, the power of even the most charismatic or ruthless leader is contingent upon the support of key institutions, themselves vulnerable to popular action or withdrawal of consent from the general population.\nOnce people decide they no longer accept the status quo and begin to resist, the balance of power shifts. For example, when millions of Americans participated in the successful five-year national boycott of grapes led by Cesar Chavez to improve the pay and workers conditions of exploited farm workers; when tens of thousands of activists effectively shut down the World Trade Organization gathering in Seattle in 1999 by blocking the streets and entrances to the convention center; when thousands of U.S. soldiers refuse to deploy or redeploy to the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, the power of the powerful is constrained, and can, in extreme situations, disintegrate entirely.\nFor activists, the key takeaway lesson of the pillars of support concept is to identify a ruling target\u2019s pillars of support, determine which can be won over and how see PRINCIPLE: Shift the spectrum of allies, and then set about working to win over, or at least neutralize, those pillars of support, so that the foundation that sustains the target begins to crumble.\nPower ultimately rests not in the grip of presidents, generals and billionaires, but in the hands of millions of ordinary people who keep society running smoothly on a day-to-day basis, and who can shut it down should they so choose. This is the meaning of the slogan people power. One of the principle reasons that so many injustices persist is not that the powerful can simply do whatever they want with impunity, but because most people are ignorant of the power they can wield by withdrawing their consent see TACTIC: General strike.\nThis understanding of power has been repeatedly vindicated in recent decades, as numerous dictators and extremely repressive regimes were toppled by unarmed people with minimal violence but much courage and creativity. These successful nonviolent struggles simply cannot be explained by someone who sees violence as the only, or even the primary, mechanism of power.\n\nBy Eric Stoner","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/pillars-of-support\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Pillars of Support\/TH_Pillars fo SUpport_Chavez.jpg","links":[105009,100191,100146,100171,100149,100128,100245,200222,200268,200219,200137,200153,300243,300209,300169,300142,300204,100138,100143,200237,500371,300263,300202,300205,300258,300214,400172,400188,400265]},{"id":300246,"type":2,"title":"Pedagogy of the Oppressed","text":"An approach to education that aims to transform oppressive structures by engaging people who have been marginalized and dehumanized and drawing on what they already know. Over a lifetime of work with revolutionary organizers and educators, radical educator Paulo Freire created an approach to emancipatory education and a lens through which to understand systems of oppression in order to transform them. He flipped mainstream pedagogy on its head by insisting that true knowledge and expertise already exist within people. They need no \u201cdeposits\u201d of information (what Freire calls \u201cbanking education\u201d), nor do they need leftist propaganda to convince them of their problems. What is required to transform the world is dialogue, critical questioning, love for humanity, and praxis, the synthesis of critical reflection and action.\nIn short, Pedagogy of the Oppressed is education as a practice of freedom, which Freire contrasts with education as a practice of domination (see below).\nBanking education:\u00a0 education as the practice of domination\nGoal is to adapt people to their oppressive conditions.\nTeacher attempts to control thinking and action of the students, who are treated as passive objects.\nAssumes that people are merely in the world, not connected to it or each other.\nRemoves students from their context; teaches reality as unchangeable.\nTreats oppressed people as marginal to a healthy society and in need of incorporation into it.\nFundamental to maintaining systems of oppression.\nProblem-posing education: education as a practice of freedom\nGoal is to transform structural oppression.\nBoth educator and educand (Freire\u2019s word for \u201cstudent,\u201d designed to convey an equitable and reciprocal relationship) teach and learn from each other.\nAssumes the world is an unfolding historical process; everything and everyone is interrelated.\nBegins with the educands\u2019 history, present and unwritten future.\nSeeks to transform society to rehumanize both the oppressed and their oppressors.\nFundamental to the revolutionary process.\nDialogue and participatory action research are two practices heavily influenced by Freire that are now common in the fields of popular education, critical pedagogy, Theater of the Oppressed, and eco-pedagogy. Freire explains that what most people think of as dialogue is really just debate, a zero-sum game in which people compete to deposit ideas into one another or name the world on behalf of others as an end in itself. In dialogue, on the other hand, both parties work together to name their world by exploring their lived experiences to identify common patterns and generate action.\nParticipatory action research, meanwhile, is a community-led process in which people determine solutions to their problems by gathering data from their peers, analyzing it, and then taking informed action. It\u2019s a model of community organizing that builds the capacity and expertise of those on the front lines.\nUnfortunately, many progressive movements today are still trapped in the \u201cbanking\u201d approach to education, seeing the public as a passive receptacle of their information. According to Freire, transforming the world requires flipping this model and replacing it with ground-up practices of emancipatory education, organizing and action.\nMOST FAMOUS APPLICATION: In the United States, Freire has inspired the movement for \u201ccritical pedagogy,\u201d which seeks to reconstruct both schools and society. Around the world, Freire\u2019s work has been used by many revolutionary movements (such as Am\u00edlcar Cabral in Guinea Bissau, the Landless Workers\u2019 Movement in Brazil, and the Zapatistas in Mexico), by popular literacy campaigns, and in the World Social Forums.\nMIS-APPLICATION: Some educators take the words \u201cpopular education\u201d to simply mean taking complex information and dumbing it down or sloganizing it, a misguided approach rooted in the very idea that Pedagogy of the Oppressed opposes: that the educators are experts while the students are empty and passive receptacles awaiting knowledge.\n\nBy Levana Saxon and Virginia Vitzthum","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed\/","links":[104800,100174,100273,200260,200232,200249,200268,200136,200137,200187,300140,100239,200270,200154,200271,300261,300200,300243,400254,404526,400172]},{"id":300263,"type":2,"title":"Narrative power analysis","text":"All power relations have a narrative dimension. Narrative power analysis is a systematic methodology for examining the stories that abet the powers that be in order to better challenge them.\r\n Human beings are literally hardwired for narrative. Stories are the threads of our lives and weave together to form the fabric of human cultures. A story can inform or deceive, enlighten or entertain, or all of the above at once. We live in a world shaped by stories.\nA traditional power analysis gives organizers and activists an understanding of the power relations and institutional dynamics among key target decision makers and allies. Narrative power analysis provides a framework to extend power analysis into narrative space \u2014 the intangible realm of stories, ideas, and assumptions that frame public perception of the situation and the players in question. Narrative helps define what is normal and what is legitimate, as well as the limits of what is politically possible. All power relations have such a narrative component.\nNarrative power analysis is based on the recognition that the currency of story is not truth, but meaning. That is, what makes a story powerful is not necessarily facts, but how the story creates meaning in the hearts and minds of the listeners. Therefore, the obstacle to convincing people is often not what they don\u2019t yet know but actually what they already do know. In other words, people\u2019s existing assumptions and beliefs can act as narrative filters to prevent them from hearing social change messages. A narrative power analysis seeks to unearth the hidden building blocks of these pernicious narratives, so that a narrative of liberation can better challenge them.\nFor example, in a traditional power analysis, a group of neighbors organizing against a proposed commercial development might determine that the mayor and the city council are the ultimate decision makers and are influenced by the developers\u2019 campaign contributions and by the opinions of voters in X precinct. Next, the group can build on that understanding with a narrative power analysis of the story and memes the developers are using to promote their agenda. This means carefully examining the developers\u2019 narrative on its own terms: how do they frame the problem they say they are solving? Who are their messengers? How do they portray the community? What are their unstated assumptions?\nFor instance, the developers may have framed their narrative around \u201cbringing jobs to the neighborhood.\u201d Armed with clarity about the developer\u2019s narrative, the neighborhood group can now craft their own narrative and design a strategy to isolate the developer. Perhaps they decide to organize those same small business owners that the developer claims to represent. Perhaps they organize a jobs fair to show that there are other ways to create employment. If the developers are counting on a \u201cYou can\u2019t fight City Hall,\u201d attitude, organizers make sure that their campaign narrative emphasizes how people power has won victories in the past. In short, the group challenges not just the economic and political forces they face, but also the narratives that back those forces up, that legitimate them and allow those forces to threaten their community.\nCurrent realities are often rooted in oppressive narratives. Our role as change agents is to undermine these narratives and replace them with new stories that help build a fairer, freer world.\n\nBy Patrick Reinsborough and Doyle Canning","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/narrative-power-analysis\/","links":[100226,100143,100218,100230,201558,200241,200232,200199,200182,200238,200249,200268,200131,200154,200220,200231,200180,200153,200183,200139,300540,300142,300204,200137,200244,200255,300259,300179,300287,300228,400194,400197,400168,400144,500342,500040,500285,500364,300192,400172,400251,400196]},{"id":300228,"type":2,"title":"Memes","text":"Memes (rhymes with \u201cdreams\u201d) are self-replicating units of cultural information that spread virally from mind to mind, network to network, generation to generation.\r\n How do ideas spread? How does cultural change happen? How does a symbol become a shared point of connection for a movement? Through memes! Understanding how to introduce and spread memes is a crucial skill for anyone who seeks to shift public opinion or cultural practices.\nA meme is like a piece of cultural DNA that evolves as it passes from person to person. The term is derived from the ancient Greek word mimema, meaning, &#8220;something imitated.\u201d Playing on the word \u201cgene,\u201d Richard Dawkins coined the term as a way of understanding how cultural practices spread. A meme is any unit of culture that has spread beyond its creator \u2014 buzz words, catchy melodies, fashion trends, ideas, rituals, iconic images, and so on.\nUnscrupulous power-holders have shown considerable skill at designing memes that spread their stories through the culture: death panels, weapons of mass destruction, the war on terror, union bosses and tax relief are all memes that have become part of the public discourse. A meme is like a viral frame that allows a story to spread, carrying a certain worldview with it.\nAlthough the term may be relatively new, memes have always been used by social movements to spread stories of liberation and change, from No taxation without representation to Black is beautiful to living wage. The incredible spread of Occupy Wall Street\u2019s meme we are the 99% has shown not only how a good meme can spread a powerful social change message but also how a shared meme can serve as an organizing tool.\nEffective memes are memorable, easy to spread and \u201csticky.\u201d In other words they linger in our consciousness, connect with our existing thinking and are easily passed on through our communications and actions. A meme that embodies a message and spreads rapidly can dramatically increase the impact of an action or campaign.\nIMPORTANT CAVEAT: A potent meme alone will not win a campaign or trigger systemic change. The right meme can, however, help people-powered organizing be exponentially more effective and influential by helping a message, an idea, or a rallying cry go viral.\n\nBy Patrick Reinsborough and Doyle Canning","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/memes\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Meme\/TH_Meme_virus.jpg","links":[104127,100177,100148,201558,200244,200229,200130,200182,200231,200139,300540,300263,100226,100239,100193,200241,200199,200134,300179,300192,300142,300243,404526,404842,500294,500310,500395,400236,400197,400167,400144]},{"id":300200,"type":2,"title":"Intellectuals and power","text":"Intellectuals should use their specialized knowledge to expose the machinations of power, utilize their position in institutions to amplify the voices of people struggling against oppression, and work tirelessly to reveal the ways that they themselves are agents of power. Michel Foucault was a French historian, social theorist and philosopher whose writings about power have had a profound impact on the humanities and the social sciences. The basic premise of Foucault\u2019s work is that power today is not something that a small number of people possess and exert on everybody else, but rather a force that acts through every institution and relationship in society, so that our very sense of self is a product of its shaping force.\nPower, according to Foucault, is diffuse, decentralized and emanates from every corner of society, not just the official seats of government. Resistance, too, is everywhere. Everywhere that people refuse to cooperate with institutional authority or to uncritically accept established patterns of social behavior, every time they attempt to re-organize social relationships according to different principles or rhythms, they resist power.\nPeople can only resist what they can see, however, so power is most effective when it remains invisible. People perceive power dynamics as immutable facts of life rather than as a historical situation that could be renegotiated. For this reason, intellectuals, engaged in the production of knowledge, particularly social scientific knowledge, are inextricably linked to the operation of power \u2014 but also, potentially, to its resistance.\nIntellectuals, as Foucault uses the term, are people who supply other people with mental frames for understanding, interpreting and interacting with the world. Scientists and engineers who work for big tech companies are intellectuals, as are freelance software developers, amateur bloggers, professors and school teachers, doctors, lawyers, advertisers and bureaucrats of every stripe.\nFor Foucault, the proper role of an intellectual is to expose the machinations of power and the systems of knowledge that justify, naturalize or conceal the operations of power. People who face the business end of domination and exploitation don\u2019t need intellectuals to tell them that they are oppressed \u2014 they know perfectly well. What they need from intellectuals is not leadership, but resources, technical knowledge and assistance in navigating dense webs of institutional power.\nIntellectuals act as agents of social change when they translate expert discourses such as law or economics into accessible language. Intellectuals, for Foucault, are at their best when, rather than telling us how the world should be, they show us that it could easily have been otherwise and, more importantly, that it need not remain the same.\n\nBy Zack Malitz","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/intellectuals-and-power\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Intellectuals and Power\/TH_Intellectuals and Power_Foucster.jpg","links":[200260,200247,200249,200136,300257,300169,300142,300246,200232,200154,200130,500324,500354]},{"id":300179,"type":2,"title":"Hashtag politics","text":"Your action or campaign doesn\u2019t just send a message, it convenes a conversation. By strategically defining the hashtag and curating the ensuing conversation, you can expand and deepen your support base. \r\n Our contemporary media environment encourages absolutely everyone to participate in conversations about current events. This means your action won\u2019t just send a message, but through social media like Twitter and Facebook, it will also convene a conversation. With hundreds of millions of people around the world participating in social networks, it\u2019s become pass\u00e9 to try to \u201cbe the media.\u201d Increasingly, activist storytelling strategies are designed to convene the conversation by practicing what one might call hashtag politics.\nTo explain the term: the users of the microblogging socialnetwork Twitter established a convention for organizing ideas, using a label called a hashtag. Twitter hashtags combine a \u201c#\u201d symbol and a keyword that connect posts from different authors (e.g., #noKXL for discussion about the Keystone XL pipeline, #OWS for Occupy Wall Street). Posts that share a hashtag can be viewed together in a single place, facilitating an ongoing public conversation.\nLike a frame, a hashtag organizes and amplifies attention. Twitter hashtags are the most literal manifestation of a broader tendency of our highly connected, socially mediated environment toward greater interactivity. Each social media network has its own method for organizing conversations, from YouTube video replies, to Facebook\u2019s friends talking about feature, to simple blog comments. The tendency is also manifested in cable network talk shows, which are nothing more than debates about current events, now more than ever supplemented with comments harvested from social media.\nTypically, the hashtag that organizes a conversation is a highly polarizing proper noun that inspires people to pick a position in a discussion about it. For instance, in 2011, UK Uncut organizers started staging protests at Vodafone stores, organizing under the hashtag #UKUncut, to reframe the discussion about austerity to focus on corporate tax dodgers rather than public spending. The role of the organizer practicing hashtag politics is to polarize a discussion effectively, and then curate the conversation to make your side more compelling. The hashtag is a framing device that helps define the values\u00a0 associated with a particular political position. To effectively practice hashtag politics, it\u2019s important to strategically and proactively define the hashtag you wish to organize the conversation around. If your hashtag is well chosen, you will draw more people to your side of the debate.\nA hashtag could be any number of things. Using narrative power analysis as one guide, you could choose to polarize a discussion around a character in your story \u2014 either a sympathetic\u00a0 character or a villain \u2014 or perhaps a scene of conflict that locates the problem we must face (like Wall Street, or the tar sands). In an increasingly socially mediated world, to craft a winning frame, it\u2019s critical to convene and curate an effective conversation that centers on a strategically chosen subject.\n\nBy Duncan Meisel","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/hashtag-politics\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Hashtag Politics\/TH_hashtag politics_hands.jpg","links":[104127,100148,200231,200180,300263,300228,100226,100193,100195,200182,200139,200137,200244,200134,200241,200158,300142,300192,400256,400188,405156,500389,500294,500775]},{"id":300202,"type":2,"title":"Hamoq and hamas","text":"Turning anger into action is necessary to move the powers that be, but that anger is most effective when it is disciplined and intelligently focused (hamas). Uncontrolled, stupid anger (hamoq) mostly undermines your own cause. The great Islamic activist Hamza Yusuf Hanson distinguishes between two forms of political action. He defines the Arabic word hamas as enthusiastic, but intelligent, anger. Hamoq means uncontrolled, stupid anger.\nThe Malays could not pronounce the Arabic H, and the British acquired the second word from them. On the streets of Genoa during the 2001 G8 summit, while the white overalls movement practiced hamas, seeking to rip down the fences around Genoa\u2019s red zone but refusing to return the blows of the police, the black block ran amok.\nThe important thing about hamas is that, whether or not it is popular, it is comprehensible. People can see immediately what you are doing and why you are doing it.\nHamoq, by contrast, leaves its spectators dumbfounded. Hamas may have demolished the McDonald\u2019s in Whitehall on May Day 2000, but it would have left the Portuguese restaurant and the souvenir shop beside it intact.\nHamas explains itself. It is a demonstration in both senses of the word: a protest and an exposition of the reasons for that protest. Hamoq, by contrast, seeks no public dialogue. Hamas is radical. Hamoq is reactionary.\nIf, like some of the black bloc warriors I have spoken to, you cannot accept this distinction, then look at how the police responded to these two very different species of anger.\nOn Friday, though they were armed to the teeth and greatly outnumbered the looters, the police stood by and watched as the black bloc rampaged around Brignole station, smashing every shopfront and overturning the residents\u2019 cars. Then, on Saturday night, on the pretext of looking for the people who had caused the violence, the police raided the schools in which members of the nonviolent Genoa Social Forum were sleeping, and started beating them to a pulp before they could get out of their sleeping bags. The police, like almost everyone else in Genoa, knew perfectly well that the black bloc were, at the time, camped in a car park miles away.\nIt is not hard to see which faction Italy\u2019s borderline-fascist state felt threatened by, and which faction it could accept and even encourage.\nIf Carlo Giuliani did not die in vain, it was because the Genoa Social Forum had so clearly articulated the case he may have been seeking to make. His hamoq forced a response because other people were practicing hamas.\nHamas instructs us to choose our enemies carefully.

It\u2019s important to know the difference, and to strike a balance between the two. Sometimes activists will take an action without much thought to how others receive it, or what precisely the action will achieve. Many people participate in actions because it\u2019s meaningful to them, or simply because it feels good to do the right thing. We call this the expressive part of an action. Expressive actions come from the heart and the gut \u2014 whether or not our \u201cheads\u201d calculate the specific outcome.\n\u201cTaking the street\u201d during a march is a perfect example. Sure, it feels good to march un-permitted in the street. You and your comrades bravely disobey police orders and, all together, walk out into traffic. You can practically smell the group cohesion in the air. It\u2019s intoxicating. It\u2019s also usually inconsequential in terms of broader social movement objectives. Still, how many times have you heard someone say a march was \u201cbad\u201d simply because it stayed on the sidewalk? When someone says this, it may be because their goals are primarily expressive; affecting social change is of secondary importance.\nMost trained organizers think on another level: regardless of the self-expressive value for those involved, we ask \u201cwhat is this action actually achieving for our issue, cause, movement, or campaign?\u201d We call this the instrumental value of an action.\nBoth aspects are important, and though a well-designed action can deliver on both simultaneously, expressive and instrumental often get pitted against one another. Many hard-nosed organizers focus exclusively on tangible impacts, forgetting that the self-expressive dimension of an action plays a critical role in affirming values and building group identity. On the other hand, many groups can carry out a whole string of expressive actions without ever winning anything. The danger here is clear: groups that don\u2019t evaluate the success of their tactics in terms of their instrumental goals risk becoming narcissistic and self-referential. They can spiral into irrelevance because they aren\u2019t tuned into how their action affects anyone outside of the group see PRINCIPLE: No one wants to watch a drum circle.\nWhile instrumental actions are often focused on an \u201cexternal\u201d outcome, say, some measurable kind of pressure you can exert on the bad guy your campaign is targeting, they can also have an \u201cinternal\u201d focus. Consider a mass teach-in that is designed to build your organization\u2019s capacity, or increase the skills of participants, or shift the thinking in your movement. Here, the expressive value of the action is being directly translated into an instrumental outcome. Expressive and instrumental are therefore not mutually exclusive categories, but rather dynamics to which we need to pay attention.\nInstrumental actions can be further subdivided into \u201ccommunicative\u201d and \u201cconcrete\u201d see PRINCIPLE: Make your actions both concrete and communicative. Communicative actions are designed to sway opinion, express an idea, or contribute to public discourse, while concrete actions are designed to have a tangible impact on a target. These are two separate ways of measuring an instrumental outcome.\nWhile self-expression is a necessary part of the social change process, it is not sufficient. Through our rituals of self-expression, we affirm our values and visions and build the kind of group identity and cohesion without which we\u2019d be too weak and disorganized to change the world see THEORY: Political identity paradox. That said, expressing values is not the same as engaging society and effecting systemic change. If we really want to change the world, we must know the difference between \u2014 and artfully balance \u2014 our instrumental goals with our desire for self-expression.\n\nBy Jonathan Matthew Smucker, Joshua Kahn Russell and Zack Malitz","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/expressive-and-instrumental-actions\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Expressive and Instrumental Actions\/TH_Expressive and Instrumental Actions_Wolves.jpg","links":[105009,100175,100195,204970,200222,200181,200238,200189,200131,200220,200180,200153,200158,100245,100149,100191,100150,100143,100272,100239,100146,200237,200212,200231,200242,200132,300178,300208,300259,400196,400236,400145,400197,400167,405098,500371,500369,500335,500308,500313,500358,500042,300287,400170,400188]},{"id":300203,"type":2,"title":"Environmental justice","text":"By exposing the connections between social justice and environmental issues we can most effectively challenge abuses of power that disproportionately target indigenous and other economically and politically disenfranchised communities. In the United States today, race and class composition are the most reliable indicators of where the wastes that industrial society creates are dumped. Invariably, they have been shown to accumulate in and around poor and racialized communities. Environmental racism refers to this tendency to burden marginalized groups with environmental problems. The movement for environmental justice is the organized response, seeking to redress the inequitable distribution of waste through both community development (greening) and political empowerment (petitioning for development and enforcement of environmental law and policies) in poor communities and communities of color.\nAfter four little girls in from the South Side Chicago Altgeld Gardens housing community died from cancer in the early 1980s, Hazel Johnson, longtime resident and founder of People for Community Recovery, put two and two together: their 190-acre community was home to over fifty documented landfills, and also to the highest incidence of cancer in the city. Her organization went on to win many grassroots struggles for environmental justice on behalf of their predominantly poor, predominantly black community, and then began networking with other organizations across the country. By the mid 1990s, the environmental justice movement had made significant strides in publicizing such issues, with organizations such as the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice staging numerous acts of civil disobedience.\nGlobally, powerful corporations have been able to spread the practice of exploiting politically vulnerable communities. As Lawrence Summers, Secretary of the Treasury under Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under Obama, argued in a 1991 memo while employed at the World Bank, \u201cthe economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that\u2026 I\u2019ve always thought that under populated countries in Africa are vastly underpolluted.\u201d A Summers aide later claimed that the memo was intended sarcastically. Sarcasm or no, the statement accurately reflects the way waste is handled under capitalism.\nWhat is at work here is not only racism, but a widespread and devastating ethic that withholds compassion from the environment and denies the humanity of ninety-nine percent of the world\u2019s people, treating them as resources to be exploited at best, or as entirely external to the economic calculations at worst.\nIt is not by chance that the civil rights movement sparked a process that, in recent decades, has culminated in a veritable explosion of environmental activism. It is because of the insidious form that racism takes under the geographical development of capitalism that an utterly unsustainable way of life was allowed to evolve to the point of global climate catastrophe.

By building a system that protects and expands our common wealth rather than one that exploits it, we can address both our ecological and social imbalances. In pre-capitalist times, shared commons were the source of sustenance for most people. Though corporations have enclosed and diminished much of the commons, it lives on in three portfolios: natural wealth (air, water, seeds, ecosystems, other species); community wealth (streets, parks, the Internet, money, social insur\u00adance); and\u00a0 cultural wealth (music, art, science, open-source software). All of these are gifts we share and are obliged to preserve for others and for future generations.\nThe trouble is that, under capitalism, common wealth is increasingly appro\u00ad\u00adpriated by private corporations and wealthy individuals for profit. To counter this, we need to expand and strengthen both the com\u00admons and the institu\u00adtions that sustain them.\nSeveral doctrines flow from the idea of the commons:\nPublic trust doctrine: The state must act as the trustee of common wealth for the benefit of all, or designate accountable trustees.\nWe\u2019re all in this together: The capitalist-era risks of unem\u00adploy\u00adment, disa\u00adbil\u00adity, illness, climate change and unfunded retirement are best shared collect\u00adively rather than borne indivi\u00addually.\nPolluter pays: Polluters should pay to dump wastes in shared eco\u00adsystems.\nPrecautionary principle: Ecosystems should be managed for long-term health, not short-term profit.\nOne person, one share: Rent from common assets belongs to every\u00adone equally.\nUsufruct: Our right to make use of a given resource is contingent upon our responsibility to preserve and enrich that resource for future generations.\nIt\u2019s important to note that, though the commons sector needs state sup\u00adport (just as the private sector does), it\u2019s not identical to the state. One can imagine a vibrant commons sector built around the Internet and the air\u00adwaves; trusts that protect key essential resources like clean air, water, forests and topsoil; universal health care; dividends paid from common wealth to everyone and local arts funds based on copyright fees.

This language not only often fails to engage, it may even alienate people who might otherwise be sympathetic. The majority of people in the global north do not identify as workers, and thus any appeal addressed to workers is unlikely to achieve results in these societies. As the industrial base of the economy has moved east and south, the language of class politics in the global north has gotten much murkier and more complicated. I propose that debt-centered organizing offers the potential to reinvigorate radical struggle in the twenty-first century.\nThe language of the labor movement emerged in an era when the power loom was the driving force of industry, nobility controlled the land and the state, and being a worker in early industry was torturous and inhumane. Most working people were direct producers. Today, most people in developed nations are non-direct producers, working in customer service, finance, and other administrative or technical fields. They are, therefore, no longer direct witnesses to the fruits of their labor being stolen from them and hoarded by capitalists, but rather are divided and subdivided in increasingly insidious ways.\nPeople today don\u2019t conceive of the \u201cproduct of their labor\u201d as the actual goods sold by their employers; in their minds, the product of their labor is their paycheck. That is what they produce, that is what is taken from their hands, not by their boss, but by their bills, their debts, their taxes. This is one reason the right has been so successful at channelling populist rage away from big business and toward big government.\nTwo decades of easy credit and bubble economics have left most people deeply in debt, often as a result of having to pay for essentials like education, childcare, housing and health care. This is a real opportunity for activists to make the case that capitalism simply can\u2019t provide essential goods fairly and efficiently, that their debts are unjust and were forced on to them. People are broke because the system is broken. We have no moral obligation to keep paying into a system that is not working.\nThe labor movement transformed the working conditions in developed nations and built the welfare state, and did so by championing the demands of the organized working class. Today, we have a debtors\u2019 consciousness, united by financial stress and economic precarity, with debt its measure.\nRealizing our collective power to withdraw our willingness to pay debts see TACTIC: Debt strike is potentially as system-shaking today as the power of the industrial working class to withdraw its labor power a century ago.

Activists should inspire radical hope by exposing the mutability of these social relationships. Commodity fetishism is the collective belief that it is natural and inevitable to measure the value of useful things with money. Marx coined the term to mock political economists who believed that carefully studying economic systems would eventually yield a set of natural laws comparable to those found in physics or chemistry.\nIn a regrettably racist outburst in Capital, Marx compared the political economists of his day to \u201cprimitive\u201d people who attributed magical powers to ordinary objects \u2014 stones, wood carvings, weapons or, in the case of the economists, physical currency. Their theories, Marx fumed, amounted to little more than a superstitious belief that animal spirits lurked in commodities, and moved markets by magic.\nMarx was convinced that most economists barely scratch the surface of economic reality because they were entranced by its elaborate symbolism: money, debt, property rights, prices and, in our time, ever more complicated methods for computing risk. For Marx, the important truths of economics could all be found in the gritty process of production, in the places where people actually worked and lived. From the roaring machinery of the factory to the rat-infested hovels of the urban proletariat, from the collapse of rural social life to the actual distribution of natural resources, the most important aspects of capitalist society were all traceable back to political domination by a small class of property owners. What really mattered about the economy,\u00a0in Marx\u2019s view, was that the ruling class could rely on its military and police forces to resolve conflicts over ownership with violence.\nMarx\u2019s point remains relevant. By the middle of the twentieth century, orthodox economics had become a heavily quantitative discipline that took pride in its alleged scientific objectivity. At the heart of modern economics is the desire to devise models capable of making accurate predictions about economic reality. Consequently, economists are still dissecting the commodity market and studying it under a microscope to discern its secrets. They tend to be skeptical of collective decision-making and favorably disposed toward markets because they mistakenly attribute agency to money and markets, in effect believing that the market is moved by mysterious forces that, whether they are natural laws or animal spirits, humans simply cannot control.\nThe challenge for anyone who wants to radically change the world is to dispel the magical aura of the market and the attendant myth of human impotence. Markets don\u2019t have power or agency, people do. Think of what happens during a revolutionary general strike. People refuse to work or perform even basic social rituals. The state dissolves overnight and, for a miraculous instant, anything is possible. Banks could be public property, roads could be pedestrian thoroughfares, shopping districts could be spaces for political deliberation and the government could really be for the people.\nAnyone who asserts that there is something inevitable in the historical process has not studied the subject. The beginning of radical hope is the recognition that social relationships are arbitrary and mutable \u2014 and need not be mediated through monetary transactions.\n\nBy Zack Malitz","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/theory\/commodity-fetishism\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/THEORY Commodity Fetishism\/TH_Commodity Fetishism_Jesus.jpg","links":[300235,300262,100149,100239,100175,100128,200154,200221,200132,300259,300176,300214,300204,400236,400185,400145,500389,500377,500381,400156]},{"id":300214,"type":2,"title":"Capitalism","text":"Capitalism is a profit-driven economic system rooted in inequality, exploitation, dispossession and environmental destruction.  The cause of the economic crisis that began in 2008 is not inadequate regulation of the free market, but runs far deeper. The global slump we are living through is the predictable manifestation of a crisis-prone economic system rooted in production for profit rather than for human need. That economic system is called capitalism, and for the sake of human development and ecological sanity it needs to be overthrown. But to be overthrown, it must first be understood.\nCapitalism is an economic system in which almost anything we need or want must be bought on the market, and in which most of us have nothing to sell but our labor. Capitalism is not a thing, but a social relation between capital and labor that divides humanity into two principal social classes: the capitalist class, or bourgeoisie, which owns the means of production (tools, resources, land), and the working class, or proletariat, which does not have access to the means of production and therefore must sell its own labor power, or ability to work.\nThe laws of competition and profit-maximization govern the capitalist market. Each enterprise exists alongside many others that are all producing similar products or services. Each needs to outperform the others, minimizing costs and maximizing profit, or they will be driven into bankruptcy. Technological innovation is one way to cut costs. Compelling employees to work harder and longer for less is another.\nCapitalists\u2019 drive to expand propels economic growth, but at a certain point, production exceeds demand, and there are too many factories and mills producing the same thing for every firm to be profitable. This is the recurring crisis of over-accumulation and profitability into which capitalism enters. While profits during the expansive phase are privatized in the pockets of owners, the costs of crisis are socialized through austerity measures, unemployment, and poverty.\nCapitalists are indifferent to the commodities they produce so long as the need to generate profit is fulfilled see THEORY: Commodity fetishism. Solar energy or tar sands oil, cluster bombs or malaria medication, it does not matter what is produced or what purpose it serves, so long as it is profitable. Capitalism in this sense means production for exchange (profit) instead of production for use (human need and ecological sustainability). The moral perversity of this dynamic is played out daily in an economy that produces luxury cars and gourmet pet food for a few, while allowing the reproduction of almost unthinkable levels of global hunger and poverty, with more than one billion people living on less that $1 per day, and another billion and a half on under $2.\nIn sum, capitalism means waste, poverty, ecological degradation, dispossession, inequality, exploitation, imperialism, war and violence. We need to build mass movements to replace it with an economic system based on production for human need and ecological sustainability, with participatory and democratic\u00a0planning, worker and community self-management, and international solidarity.\n\nBy Jeffery R.

Bertolt Brecht, German leftist playwright and director, had nothing but disdain for the conventional, commercial \u201cbourgeois\u201d theater of his time. He considered it a \u201cbranch of the narcotics business.\u201d Why? The theater of his time, like most Hollywood movies now, relied on emotional manipulation to bring about a suspension of disbelief for the audience, along with an emotional identification with the main character. Audience members were taken on an uncritical emotional roller coaster ride, crying when the main character cried, laughing when s\/he laughed \u2014 identifying with him\/her even when the character had nothing in common with them or their interests (working-class audiences swooningly identifying with a Prince of Denmark, for example).\nBrecht saw that these audiences were manipulated by theater technology \u2014 beautiful, realistic sets, cleverly naturalistic lighting, the imaginary fourth wall, and most importantly, emotionally effusive acting techniques. He soon watched with horror as the Nazi movement gained popular support in his country with its racist, xenophobic demagoguery, relying on similar emotional manipulation. Emotional manipulation was, to him, Enemy Number One of human decency.\nIt was in this context that Brecht developed his theory of Verfremdungseffekt, also known as V-effekt, alienation effect, or distantiation effect. (Important disclaimer: there is compelling evidence that many of Brecht\u2019s greatest ideas were developed in uncredited cooperation with his artistic partners).\nThe alienation effect attempts to combat emotional manipulation in the theater, replacing it with an entertaining or surprising jolt. For instance, rather than investing in or \u201cbecoming\u201d their characters, they might emotionally step away and demonstrate them with cool, witty, and skillful self-critique. The director could \u201cbreak the fourth wall\u201d and expose the technology of the theater to the audience in amusing ways. Or a technique known as the social gest could be used to expose unjust social power relationships so the audience sees these relationships in a new way. The social gest is an exaggerated gesture or action that is not to be taken literally but which critically demonstrates a social relationship or power imbalance. For example, workers in a corporate office may suddenly and quickly drop to the floor and kowtow to the CEO, or the women in a household may suddenly start to move in fast-motion, cleaning the house, while the men slowly yawn and loaf around.\nBy showing the instruments of theater and how they can be manipulative \u2014 for example, the actor calling out \u201cCue the angry red spotlight!\u201d before he shrieks with rage, or \u201cTime for the gleeful violin\u201d before dancing happily as the violinist joins him on stage, or visibly dabbing water on his eyes when he is supposed to cry . . . the audience can be entertained without being manipulated. Many of Brecht\u2019s techniques have been co-opted and incorporated into contemporary bourgeois theater and film, though his challenge remains relevant: how to confront the problem of emotional manipulation while creating a stimulating, surprising, entertaining, radically critical, popularly appealing and accessible social art practice.\n\nBy L.M.

What do they want?\nWith good action logic, nobody needs to ask those questions; an outsider can look at what you\u2019re doing and immediately understand why you\u2019re doing it. For example, people doing a tree-sit so the forest cannot be cut down \u2014 the logic is clear and obvious.

It may sound paradoxical, but it often requires lots of thought and care to design actions that make intuitive sense.\nCivil disobedience actions \u2014 for example the lunch counter sit-ins of the American civil rights movement \u2014 tend to have inherent action logic because their purpose is to violate an unjust law in order to highlight exactly that injustice. However, other forms of direct action, which sometimes break laws unrelated to their goal, often need to do some extra work to achieve clear action logic.\nCommunicative actions see THEORY: Expressive and instrumental actions also need to foster action logic. Camp Casey, where Cindy Sheehan camped outside Bush\u2019s vacation ranch until he came out and explained for what \u201cnoble cause\u201d her Iraq veteran son Casey had died, had powerful action logic. So did the single moms in Rhode Island who pressured a public housing official for a day care center by not just sitting-in at his office, but bringing their kids with them and, for a few hours, turning his office into the day care center they needed see\u00a0CASE: Day care center sit-in.\nMost successful actions have this kind of inherent, transparent logic. They speak for themselves. When your action has this kind of clarity at its core, then no matter how the target responds or how things play out, the action will continue to make your point and make sense to observers.\nMOST FAMOUS APPLICATION:\u00a0The lunch counter sit-ins during the civil rights movement had remarkable action logic. When legal segregation was enforced, black and white students violated the law by sitting at lunch counters and waiting to be served.

First introduced in a 2004 article by Andrew Boyd and Stephen Duncombe and later expanded in Duncombe\u2019s 2007 book Dream, the theory\u2019s premises are: (1) that politics is as much an affair of desire and fantasy as it is reason and rationality, (2) that we live in an intensely mediated age (what Situationist Guy Debord called the Society of the Spectacle), (3) that in order to be politically effective, activists need to enter the realm of spectacle, and (4) that spectacular interventions have the potential to be both ethical and emancipatory.\nAn ethical spectacle is a symbolic action that seeks to shift the political culture toward more progressive values. An ethical spectacle should strive to be:\n\u0007Participatory: Seeking to empower participants and spectators alike, with organizers acting as facilitators.\n\u0007Open: Responsive and adaptive to shifting contexts and the ideas of participants.\n\u0007Transparent: Engaging the imagination of spectators with out seeking to trick or deceive.\n\u0007Realistic: Using fantasy to illuminate and dramatize real-world power dynamics and social relations that otherwise tend to remain hidden in plain sight.\n\u0007Utopian: Celebrating the impossible \u2014 and therefore helping to make the impossible possible.\nProgressives tend to distrust anything that smacks of propaganda or marketing \u2014 that\u2019s what the other side does.

It must have stories woven around it, works of art made about it; it must be communicated in new and compelling ways that can be passed from person to person, even if this requires flights of fancy and new mythologies.

The Zapatistas\u2019 iconic black balaclava was not just a necessity for personal security, but became a powerful statement of unity and universality. \u201cBehind our black mask,\u201d they declared, \u201cwe are you.\u201d[1]\nIn 2008, presidential candidate Barack Obama also made masterful use of floating signifiers. His poetic rhetoric of \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange we can believe in\u201d inspired a population weary from eight years of misrule. He became whatever his supporters wanted him to be. Obama explicitly acknowledged this phenomenon in the prologue to his campaign screed, The Audacity of Hope: \u201cI serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.\u201d\nFinding the right floating signifier can make or break a social movement or campaign. When a challenger social movement hits upon such a catalyzing symbol, it\u2019s like striking gold. One might even argue that broad social movements are constituted in the act of finding their floating signifier. Hitherto disparate groups suddenly congeal into a powerful aligned force. Momentum is on their side, and things that seemed impossible only yesterday become visible on the horizon.[2]\nIndeed, the power of a good floating signifier was perhaps nowhere more evident than in the overnight growth of Occupy Wall Street see CASE. Far eclipsing the literal physical occupation in Zucotti Park, OWS resonated so far and wide because it served as a symbol about standing up to powerful elites on their own doorstep. To many people, the \u201coccupy\u201d in \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d essentially stands in for the F word. Millions of Americans were waiting for someone or something to stand up to Wall Street, the big banks, the mega-corporations, and the political elite. Then one day, a relatively small crew of audacious and persistent New Yorkers became that someone or something \u2014 became the catalyzing symbol of defiance we\u2019d been waiting for. And by having an open process, and not fixing its meaning early with a ten-point program or the like, the symbol was able to continue \u201cfloating\u201d.\nIt\u2019s not that the symbol is empty of meaning. Both \u201coccupy\u201d and \u201cthe 99%\u201d carry content that strategically frames public thinking and pulls the political discourse in a clear direction. But a degree of ambiguity is absolutely necessary if such a symbol is to catalyze a broad alignment. If the symbol\u2019s meaning becomes too particular \u2014 too associated with any one current or group within the alignment \u2014 it risks losing its powerfully broad appeal. This is why the forces defending the status quo try to nail it down. Their hope is that by fixing it to particular meanings, associating it with particular \u201ckinds of people\u201d and to narrower frameworks, it will no longer function as a popular symbol.\nFloat on, beautiful signifier.

Indigenous communities immediately voiced concerns. In Saskatchewan, four women \u2014 three Indigenous and one non-native \u2014 launched a teach-in and website in order to raise awareness about the issue. They dubbed their effort Idle No More.\nBy December, the \u201cIdle No More\u201d movement was in full swing. Rallies were being held across Canada and internationally; the hash tag #idlenomore was trending on Twitter; and Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence was on hunger strike seeking a meeting with the Canadian government. The movement had quickly broadened to encompass a collective demand for governments worldwide to \u201chonor Indigenous sovereignty and to protect the land and water,\u201d as the group\u2019s website declared.\nIt was in this context that a group of organizers put out a call to action on Facebook asking \u201cAboriginal people, non-Aboriginal people, Met\u00eds, youth, and anyone willing to dance\/sing\/drum with us\u201d to meet at the Cornwall Centre shopping mall in Regina, Saskatchewan. At 7:00pm on December 17, Aboriginal activists gathered at the mall and began beating out a steady rhythm on hand drums and singing. Others soon emerged from the holiday shopping crowd to join hands around the mall\u2019s massive Christmas tree, circling clockwise in a traditional Indigenous round dance. By the end, an intergenerational and interracial group of over 500 people had gathered on two floors to take part in the action. Mall security and city police arrived, but the flash mob remained entirely peaceful before melting away.\nWhile the flash mob itself lasted less than 15 minutes, videos and articles about it circulated widely on the Internet. Another round dance took place the following day in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta. These actions captured the imagination of others in the movement, and dozens of round dance flash mobs began popping up in malls and public spaces across Canada and the United States. On December 29, over 1,000 people gathered for a round dance protest at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.\nRound dances, often used as a form of celebration and as an expression of friendship and unity, are practiced in different forms by many Indigenous nations in North America. Along with many other aspects of Indigenous culture, the round dance was suppressed in the process of colonization, but it has recently reemerged as a celebratory practice, and recorded round dance music has become increasingly popular. The round dance flash mobs, then, represented both a powerful expression of resistance and a practice of cultural regeneration.\nRound dance flash mobs became a strong enough presence in the Idle No More movement for some to begin referring to it as the \u201cround dance revolution.\u201d Organizers had hit upon a way to combine social media and flash mobs \u2014 both highly popular forms of activism among young people \u2014 with traditional music and dance in a way that bridged generations and cultures, creating space for building a sense of community. The round dances symbolized the movement\u2019s core tenets of peace and unity, while sending the simple message: \u201cWe are here, our culture is strong, and we will not be silent in the face of destruction.\u201d\n\nBy Paul Kuttner","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/idle-dance-flash-mob\/","links":[100191,100193,100148,200181,200232,200229,200130,200189,200154,200269,300179,300203,300287]},{"id":405098,"type":3,"title":"Brazil&#8217;s Free Fare Movement","text":"Ten years ago in Brazil, a horizontal, autonomous, independent and non-partisan movement called the Free Fare Movement (Movimento Passe Livre) was formed to fight for free, high-quality public transportation.

Since then, every time a municipal government in Brazil has tried to increase public transportation fares, the Free Fare Movement has mobilized to oppose the increase and push for free public transportation. In June 2013, these protests snowballed into a mass uprising, successfully reversing a planned fare hike and awakening a generation of young activists to the power of mass demonstrations.\nWhen S\u00e3o Paulo and several other Brazilian cities announced fare hikes that summer, the Free Fare Movement took to the streets. Unlike past years, when the movement held actions on a weekly basis, organizers opted for more frequent demonstrations. Every second day, at rush hour, activists occupied S\u00e3o Paulo&#8217;s main avenues and interrupted traffic for hours. At the end of each action, protesters would disperse chanting: &#8220;Tomorrow it will be bigger!&#8221;\nAnd it was.\nAs the movement gathered steam, the police responded with repression, and the corporate media consistently portrayed protesters as vandals and hooligans, constantly running images of broken storefronts and burned buses. In contrast, social media were inundated with accounts of police violence and excessive use of tasers, pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets, generating widespread support for the demonstrations.\nProtesters and journalists started carrying vinegar with them to reduce the effects of police tear gas. The police responded by arresting anyone caught carrying vinegar, provoking widespread ridicule, as memes proliferated on social media celebrating &#8220;Salad Uprising,&#8221; &#8220;V for Vinegar,&#8221; &#8220;Vinegar Revolt,&#8221; and so on.\nOn the day of the fifth action, more than 100,000 people flooded the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo. The wave of protests reached a level that hadn\u2019t been seen in Brazil since the struggle for democracy under military rule. A few days later over a million people in hundreds of cities took to the streets, marching not just for affordable public transportation, but against corruption, for better health care, and many other causes. Finally, after two weeks of near-continuous street actions, officials announced that the fare increase would be reversed.\nEveryone felt the irresistible people power on the streets.

Organizers needed a way to call attention to the issue of unaffordable housing that would profoundly shift how the public thought about the issue.\nThis protest spectacle was devised to work in two ways: It would occupy public space as a form of protest against real estate speculation, and it would bring the problem of access to housing to the public eye. To achieve the latter, it was essential to create a story that a lot of people could identify with. It had to be a story where the protagonists would be regular people who suffer daily and personally due to the devastating effects of real estate speculation. The arc of the story had to reach its climax on the day of the action and, afterward, it had to stay in the collective imagination for a long time. That was the action&#8217;s primary objective. And it more than succeeded.\nOrganizers contacted the Guinness World Records organization in an attempt to include the event in their catalog. After extensive negotiations, the Guinness technical team rejected the proposal on the grounds that it was &#8220;too strange&#8221; (this from the weirdos at Guinness??). Of course, that decision didn&#8217;t discourage the organizers one bit. They moved on with their plan.\nTo publicize the event, organizers used every single resource that they had available to them, including a series of viral videos that received thousands of visits in the days leading up to the event.\nEvents were staged across Spain; Barcelona\u2019s was the largest. An enormous stage was set up in front of Barcelona&#8217;s city council and from there a group of entertainers and activists led the action, all of it conceived as a grand spectacle. Above the stage, a large screen showed live images from the gatherings that were happening in other cities. The screen also displayed a &#8220;put\u00f3metro&#8221; (a fucked-o-meter), a gauge to measure the fury of the shouting crowd, designed specially for the occasion.\nThe event was a complete success: The thousands of participants broke the record on their first try. And with it, the issue of access to housing shifted from being perceived as a personal problem to what it is increasingly seen as in Spain today: an authentic social conflict requiring record-breaking collective action to resolve it.\n\nBy Leonidas Martin Saura and Mario Ortega","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/world-record-number-people-shouting\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/CS_World-record-for-number-of-people-shouting_crowd.jpg","links":[100193,100177,100138,100195,100148,200221,200241,200229,200233,200189,200129,200134,200180,200139,200158,300243,300178,300228,300262,300208,300192,100149]},{"id":404749,"type":3,"title":"Pimp My&#8230; Carro\u00e7a!","text":"Carro\u00e7a is the Portuguese word for carriage \u2014 that is, a wheeled vehicle for conveying people, often drawn by horses, and designed for comfort and elegance.

Curiously, in Brazil this word also refers to the ramshackle carts that some human beings are compelled to use. These are the collectors of recyclable materials, or just \u201ccollectors\u201d \u2014 the thousands of informal workers that scavenge, carry, and sell reusable supplies to local junk shops or recycling co-ops.\nWherever there is unemployment and waste, they will be found. In S\u00e3o Paulo, which lacks selective garbage collection, they are responsible for 90% of all the city\u2019s recycling. Yet no official support or protection to collectors has ever existed. Since their source of income is considered trash by many people, they are called all sorts of derogatory names, such as idle, homeless or lazy. Even though they help clean the city, some consider them a social problem.\nHow to bring visibility and respect to these marginalized citizens? By means of a marginalized, invisible and disrespected art. In Brazil, graffiti is considered a crime against the environment, but it was a graffiti artist, and not a politician, who first called attention to the important role collectors played.\nMundano began as a tagger, then he became an \u201cartivist\u201d \u2014 that is, an artist working for political ends. He began writing messages on carro\u00e7as such as \u201cproud to be a collector,\u201d \u201crecycle your concepts\u201d and \u201cmy car doesn\u2019t pollute.\u201d This became his life project, so that over five years he traveled to many countries, decorating around 160 \u201ccarro\u00e7as.\u201d\nHowever, what he could achieve working alone was limited, so he gathered friends and supporters together to dream up a bigger initiative. That\u2019s when Pimp My Carro\u00e7a was conceived \u2014 a social parody of MTV\u2019s popular show Pimp My Ride, in which real people got to have their old and run-down cars fixed up and personalized. The Pimp My Carro\u00e7a project was submitted to a crowdfunding platform, where 792 sponsors contributed over $30,000.\nPimp My Carro\u00e7a culminated in an event in the historic center of S\u00e3o Paulo. Dozens of volunteer artists were on-hand to \u201cpimp\u201d collectors\u2019 carts: fix and improve their structure, add safety devices such as rear view mirrors and reflective stickers, and, finally, decorate the carts with colorful, critical messages.\nWhile their carts were being \u201cpimped,\u201d the participating collectors were offered free meals, haircuts, health check-ups and therapy sessions. They also received an official T-shirt made of recycled materials and, when needed, a pair of glasses. Parades and music concerts created a cheerful atmosphere, showing that civil society was finally fighting for the acknowledgment of collectors.\nThe day closed with a Carroceata (a play on the Portuguese words for carts and demonstrations): the collectors marched to City Hall with their carts pimped out, where they read the &#8220;Pimp my Carro\u00e7a Manifesto&#8221; demanding fairer conditions for collectors and denouncing the lack of recycling in the city.

Immediately thereafter, those two companies put an enormous Futbol Club Barcelona team jersey on the sculpture and began selling athletic shoes and low-cost trips to tourist destinations in front of the monument.\nThe advertisement quickly caught the attention of the major TV networks and the most popular magazines, putting Spain back in the international spotlight by highlighting the thing that it is best known for: its sporting victories. Spaniards are rightly proud of being world champions in football (\u201csoccer,\u201d to North Americans), basketball, MotoGP, and other sports. But the Spanish media is less likely to trumpet the fact that Spain is also a world champion of unemployment: 6 million jobless and rising (almost half of all working-age young people) as of early 2013. For Enmedio, a radical design collective, this issue was worthy of some subversive attention.\nThe first thing Enmedio did was call a press conference at the base of the Columbus Monument for noon \u2014 peak time for tourists. The press had already spilled rivers of ink on the city council&#8217;s privatization of a piece of public art.

In 2010, New York passed the very first Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, followed by Hawaii and California, with other states soon to follow. In the wake of these major victories, a challenge arose for organizers, who recognized that these victories would be hollow if workers remained unaware of the changes. Given that domestic workers generally have low print literacy, don\u2019t regularly listen to the radio, and often work in isolation, how best to inform them about their newly enshrined rights? And how to communicate the law \u2014\u00a0a wonky snore-fest \u2014\u00a0in a lively and engaging way that domestic workers could act on?\nTo help address this challenge, in 2011, Domestic Workers United, a New York City-based advocacy group, turned to REV-, a non-profit art, media, and social justice studio that had provided media training for domestic worker groups city-wide. Through a survey, they noted that one thing that all domestic workers have is at least a basic cell phone. Could we transform the cell phone into a tool for popular education? Collaborators from MIT Center for Civic Media and Terravoz were brought in to flex their tech, while lawyers from local community groups (the Urban Justice Center and the National Employment Law Project) were brought in to ensure that the creative work of the project aligns with long-term legal advocacy goals (see PRINCIPLE: Use the law, don\u2019t be afraid of it).\nWith REV- at the helm, the team created a public art nanny hotline. Here\u2019s how it works: using even the simplest of cell phones, users can call (347) WORK-500 and hear humorous episodes of a show called New Day New Standard (think \u2018Click and Clack\u2019 from NPR\u2019s Car Talk, but for nannies) about topics like overtime wages, tax requirements, trafficking, and more.\nUsers would call in to hear New Day New Standard\u2019s host, Christine Yvette Lewis, a spunky nanny and advocate from Trinidad &amp; Tobago whose charisma had landed her a guest spot on the Colbert Report \u2014\u00a0bantering back and forth with the fictional Miss Know-It-All and other characters calling in to the fake talk show.\nThe project launched in May 2012 as part of a city-wide campaign led by domestic worker groups. Each month since then, the hotline receives from 400 to 1200 calls a month. While the hotline\u2019s primary audience is domestic workers, the project and its message were carried further through media attention (BBC, GOOD magazine, parent blogs) and through presentations at the White House (yes, that White House), universities, and film festivals such as Tribeca Film Institute.\nIn response to the requests of domestic worker groups from coast to coast, in early 2014, REV- led a collaboration that includes new partners like The National Domestic Workers Alliance and NuLawLab in the creation of a souped up national nanny hotline whose content is being created with workers around the US via a mobile design studio and sound lab dubbed NannyVan. The national hotline, appropriately called \u201cThe NannyVan App\u201d \u2014\u00a0but still accessible by any kind of phone \u2014\u00a0features new functionalities such as the ability to subscribe to weekly SMS tips about topics like the law, domestic worker history, health and safety, and the growing movement.\nCall (347) WORK-500 to check out more!\n\nBy Marisa Jahn","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/public-art-nanny-hotline\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/CS_nanny-hotline-logo.png","links":[100198,200248,200232,200244,200220,200180,200158,300201,300246,300228]},{"id":400164,"type":3,"title":"Lysistrata Project","text":"It was early 2003.

In the face of unprecedented global public opposition, the Bush Administration was moving relentlessly toward an illegal and unjustified war with Iraq. Desperate to stop the war, people all over the world were seeking creative ways to voice their opposition.\nInspired by the recently organized New York group Theaters Against War, Sharron Bower and I, both of us actors, organized an international day of theatrical action centered around a famous ancient Greek anti-war comedy, Lysistrata. Written by the playwright Aristophanes, Lysistrata tells the fictitious story of the women of Greece ending the Peloponnesian War by refusing sex until the men quit fighting. Productions traditionally involve nudity on the part of the women and excessively large phalli on the priapically crippled men \u2014 conditions which make viewing the play a highly memorable experience.\nOver the course of a few days, Bower and I set up a website that served as an instruction manual for organizing a reading of the play. It contained downloadable logos, posters, fliers, a sample press release, a top-ten list of reasons for opposing the war, instructions for organizing a reading and a page listing readings by geographic area with contact information. We then sent an email to everyone we knew offering this reading as a fun, powerful means of opposing the impending war. We suggested people adapt the play to the needs of their own community, and feel free to do readings anywhere that suited them.\nEveryone we knew forwarded the email to everyone they knew, and we started getting phone calls and emails from all over the world, including one from a college student in Texas which read:\nFINALLY! SOMETHING WE CAN DO! I\u2019M SKIPPING CLASS TO GO ORGANIZE A READING IN THE QUAD. THANK YOU FOR THINKING OF THIS!

The readings received widespread news coverage in the U.S. and around the world. There were two star-studded readings in New York and LA, and smaller readings in living rooms, churches, parks, rain forest campsites, community theaters, trailer park diners, a Kurdish refugee camp, as well as at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens where the play is set.

Justice for Janitors had hit upon one of the most successful union organizing strategies in recent U.S. history, and the Days of Rage model has been repeated in many places since then.\nThe model requires several key components: 1) a visibility campaign designed to permeate the collective consciousness, 2) strategic research and campaign planning to create a map and calendar of opportunities, and 3) creative and escalating direct actions focused on a clear target. Combined, these elements help create a political crisis that forces the opponent to either resolve the issues or lose standing in the community.\n\u201cD.C. Has Carr Trouble\u201d was our main slogan in December of 1994. Oliver Carr was the biggest commercial real estate owner in D.C. and we thought our little pun creative, given how traffic was sure to be impacted by our bridge-blockading actions. We blocked buildings and parking garages of key real estate giants, took over lobbies and the streets, and got arrested throughout the week.\nIn March we went to the homes of real estate moguls and blocked the roads to the Capitol building by erecting mock houses in traffic lanes. Then we simultaneously took over the City Council Chambers, the office of Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, and disrupted Congress from the House Gallery right after the morning prayer, demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share.\nSeptember culminated in a massive action shutting down a major bridge from Virginia into D.C. In the middle of the highway, hundreds of janitors erected a classroom, complete with desks and chalk boards. We also parked a school bus and a school van across all four lanes, effectively closing the bridge.\nWhen called out for blocking the bridges, SEIU President John Sweeney replied: \u201cI believe in building bridges whenever [we can] be a full partner with our employers and a full citizen of the communities we live in. But I believe in blocking bridges whenever those employers and those communities turn a deaf ear to the working families we represent.\u201d\nThe September actions had an impact beyond our expectations. Some Cabinet members couldn\u2019t commute in. Flights were delayed at Reagan National Airport and the Senate had to delay votes. Needless to say, it was soon made a felony to block a bridge in D.C. Meanwhile, though, we had captured the hearts and minds of people in D.C. for whom janitors were no longer invisible.\nThe Janitors for Justice creative direct action model of organizing has been used again and again to great success, including the series of street actions in New York during the week of May 12, 2011, which to some degree set the stage for Occupy Wall Street and the growing movement against Big Banking.\n\nBy Lisa Fithian","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/justice-for-janitors-d-c\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Justice for Janitors\/CA_Justice for Janitors_schoolbus_wideangle.jpg","links":[100143,100149,200222,200260,200264,200237,200153,100138,100161,100245,200137,200244,200526,200132,200190,300204,300201,300246,300259,300263]},{"id":400145,"type":3,"title":"Battle in Seattle","text":"In 1999, the World Trade Organization decided to hold global capitalism\u2019s board meeting in Seattle, WA.

Most Americans had never heard of the WTO before, but savvy organizers across a spectrum of single-issue silos, including labor, environmental, human rights and others, decided that they would team up and act like a movement for a change. Our critiques of neoliberalism varied widely and there were both reformers and abolitionists in our ranks, but we were united in the recognition that the meeting represented a potent symbolic target for anyone challenging the juggernaut of undemocratic global corporate power.\nRadicals and liberals agreed early on that a healthy inside\/outside strategy was called for. A critical mass of activists began organizing, recruiting and training together to attempt a many-thousands-strong blockade of the WTO ministerial. We believed that if we could achieve the tactical victory of a mass shutdown of the WTO\u2019s coming-out party, it would strengthen the hands of everyone working against corporate globalization.\nScores of affinity groups organized themselves into thirteen \u201cclusters\u201d and through a highly functional (and democratic) spokescouncil, hammered out a plan to capture the key intersections around the Seattle Convention Center in a massive nonviolent blockade. And so, in the predawn darkness of November 30, 5,000 direct actionistas marched through the streets of Seattle toward their targets. Each individual action had its own logic and narrative. Each would have stood on its own as extraordinary. When connected together, they became unstoppable.\nThe action frame we chose was carnival-protest, equal parts communicative and concrete see PRINCIPLE: Make your actions both concrete and communicative. Outside the stodgy corporate meeting, a giant dance party broke out, complete with marching bands, dancers, theater troupes, giant puppets, radical cheerleaders, a phalanx of 300 turtles and even Christmas carolers. Thousands of folks joined together (with hands and chains) around key entrances and intersections, preventing delegates from entering (that was the instrumental part). It could have looked threatening, but with all the celebratory art and solidarity, we looked beautiful and human doing it. Our theme was \u201cAnother World Is Possible\u201d and we were living it out.\nBy morning, 5,000 more folks, inspired by the audacity and courage of these artful actions, had spontaneously joined the human wall around the WTO. Teamsters and turtles were literally dancing together in the streets. A few hours later, as the Seattle police unleashed a torrent of tear gas and pepper spray to crack the blockade, 50,000 labor marchers defied their own marshals and reinforced us with a sea of humanity. The biggest business meeting on Earth had been shut down, a tactical victory most thought impossible. And the rest, as they say, is history.\nThe impact of Seattle was enormous. It launched the global justice movement in the Global North. It showed that a people\u2019s victory against global capital was possible. It created a teachable moment \u2014 for the public, on the WTO and the dark side of corporate globalization, and also for the movement, showcasing direct and mass action tactics and a carnivalesque sensibility that are still influential today, as well as training a new wave of actionistas who have gone on to play critical roles across the next decade of progressive movements.\n\nBy John Sellers","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/battle-in-seattle\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Battle in Seattle\/CA_Battle in Seattle_banner.jpg","links":[105009,100226,100138,100149,100245,100150,200222,200212,200227,200182,200131,200132,200129,200136,300140,300209,300169,300204,300205,300258,300214,300287,100161,100191,200137,200153,200241,300202,500299]},{"id":400170,"type":3,"title":"99% bat signal","text":"A coalition of labor unions had called for a national day of action on November 17 to push back against austerity and demand infrastructure improvements and jobs.

Actions were planned for seventeen bridges in seventeen cities. In New York City, a permit was obtained for a large rally in the Wall Street area, with a march over the Brooklyn Bridge to follow. November 17 also happened to be the two-month birthday celebration for #Occupy Wall Street. People wanted something spectacular to happen, something beautiful.\nThe November 17 action coordination working group planned to purchase ten thousand small LED lights to hand out to the crowd as they encircled City Hall and streamed over the pedestrian walkway of the bridge, creating a river of light. The metaphor of light was important, as we were celebrating Occupy Wall Street\u2019s commitment to shining a light on a corrupt and broken political and economic system. But we needed something bigger. We started talking about projections, and Hero (yes, his name is Hero) suggested a \u201cbat signal.\u201d A big circle with \u201c99%\u201d in the middle. It seemed too perfect, so we got to work making that a reality.\nWithin spitting distance of the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian walkway stands a thirty-two-story gray concrete slab of a building commonly known as \u201cthe Verizon building.\u201d A flat windowless expanse approximately seventy-five feet in width extends up the face, with low ambient light. City housing projects fifteen stories tall sit in its shadow. We had our projection screen. We had secured the loan of a powerful projector. We had ideas for content.\nWhat we needed was a projection room.\nWe needed to project from an apartment in one of those buildings. I put up signs offering $250 for the use of an apartment for an art and film project. There were few calls at first, but eventually a call came in from one Denise Vega \u2014 a single mother of two, born and raised in those housing projects and working to keep her family fed. She had the window we needed, and more importantly a supportive and enthusiastic attitude. In the end she refused to take any money for the use of her home, declaring, \u201cI can\u2019t charge you money, this is for the people.\u201d\nIn the days before the action we began to realize that we would be able to project not just the 99% symbol, but also words large enough and bright enough for people to read from the bridge. This opened up many possibilities. What if we could get the crowd to interact with the projections? We would need to project chants in the proper cadence, to get people started. After that, we imagined that we might be able to get people to use the \u201chuman microphone\u201d to \u201cmic check\u201d a brief statement.\nAmazingly, all went as planned, and the action was even more successful that we could have hoped for. The 20,000-strong crowd on the bridge went crazy. We could hear them shouting, cheering, and, yes, \u201cmic-checking\u201d from the window of Denise\u2019s bedroom. We were interacting with the crowd, mixing the projections on the fly in response to the crowd\u2019s reactions. It was the galvanizing, unifying moment of joy and celebration that we\u2019d hoped to provide this burgeoning global movement for a more just and democratic world.\n\nBy Mark Read","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/99-bat-signal\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE 99 Bat Signal\/CA_99 Bat Signal_99_portrait.jpg","links":[104127,100177,100272,200180,200139,200158,300192,100138,100239,100149,200189,200244,200225,200132,200134,200199,200231,200181,300208,300209,300204,300205]},{"id":400210,"type":3,"title":"Yomango","text":"On July 5, 2002, a strange new brand began cropping up in the streets of Barcelona.

That day, at the height of sales season, more than fifty people rushed through the center of Barcelona to the Bershka clothing store to perform the very first Yomango fashion show.\nThe show lived up to its \u201cmagical\u201d billing: a simple object was turned into a symbol of another way of living. To be more precise, a ten-euro dress was spirited from the store, later to show up as a work of art at one of the most important art museums in the city. All the activities of Yomango were open, public and publicized.\nThe name \u201cYomango\u201d and the lifestyle it celebrates refers to mangar, a Spanish slang term meaning \u201cto shoplift,\u201d particularly from multinational corporations. The concept of ethical shoplifting had suddenly acquired public visibility.\nThe Yomango brand is itself a reappropriation, or d\u00e9tournement, of the wildly popular Mango brand see TACTIC: D\u00e9tournement\/Culture jamming. By adding a pronominal prefix (yo, or \u201cI\u201d in Spanish) to the clothing company\u2019s name, the modified brand takes on a different meaning entirely: I swipe. Yomango disrupts the primary goal of the original brand, turning it into a new direct-action practice based on the widespread habit of shoplifting.\nAt first glance, this may seem like a simple surrender to the greedy logic of capitalism, but nothing could be further from the truth. As Yomango states on its website, its only interest in commodities is \u201cto make something new happen in their midst, to push them to the point of turning them into something else, something that has nothing to do with producing a way of life that is dedicated to consumption, but rather moves toward inventing new possible ways of living.\u201d\nThrough its actions and its philosophy, but also through its style and design, Yomango turns the impulse to shoplift into a movement, a method, an art. For instance, Yomango introduced designs that were not only cool, but also served as gear for shoplifting, such as a \u201cjacket of a thousand pockets,\u201d in which all the many pockets were interconnected. When an object is surreptitiously placed in the jacket, it simply disappears, only to be discovered again sometime later, perhaps in the safety of your own home.\nThanks to a proliferation of workshops in arts institutions and social organizations in cities around the world, Yomango\u2019s actions have expanded since the anti-brand first debuted. The website \u2014 built on an open-publishing framework enabling people to exchange information and experiences with anyone else captivated by the Yomango brand \u2014 also contributed to its spread. Various Yomango communities began appearing in different parts of the world: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Germany, Italy, as well as other Spanish cities including Madrid and Bilbao.\nThough it celebrates individual acts of self-liberation, the Yomango brand also gestures toward mass political action, with actions targeting various multinational corporations, such as the \u201cYomango-Tango,\u201d in which a crowd of Yomango dancers in Argentina liberated hundreds of bottles of Champagne from a Carrefour supermarket, and then uncorked and drank them in a branch of Banco Santander \u2014 both entities directly implicated in the Argentinian economic crisis.\nThese actions have served as brand advertisements as enticing as the glittering billboards in the heart of the metropolis. In this way, the Yomango brand spreads through direct-action events and highly diverse avenues of communication: from the alternative media to the official press, from supermarkets to activist meetings, and from art catalogs to the Internet. The anti-brand is designed so that any person or group can reappropriate it in whatever manner he\/she\/it chooses, transforming it, plagiarizing it, elaborating on it.\nYomango. You want it?

Though the protests were ultimately unsuccessful, they heralded a major watershed in the labor movement\u2019s resistance to austerity cuts.\nProtests began shortly after Gov. Walker proposed his legislation. On February 14, a group of unionized teaching assistants from the University of Wisconsin at Madison led a Valentine\u2019s Day-themed protest at the capitol, joined by labor and student groups. Labor-student collaboration became a model for the remainder of the organizing, as state employees used their workplaces and community roles to contact peoplenot immediately affected, widening the struggle and helping provoke a political crisis in the state.\nWisconsin state law allowed for the capitol to remain open as long as public debate continued about a pending bill. The teaching assistants noticed that the senate had failed to set a limit on the number of speakers on a floor debate about Walker\u2019s bill, and so signed up thousands of people to offer testimony. This kept debate open indefinitely, as well as the capitol itself, and eventually turned the occupation into a twenty-four-hour speak-out, with a microphone set up in the middle of the rotunda. The microphone served as an invitation to everyone to be heard at the protest, and triggered an important shift in tone and approach. What had begun as a simple defense of workers\u2019 rights now shifted to become an inclusive forum for multiple groups hurt by budget cuts. The boldness and persistence of the tactic galvanized thousands of people to join in, and within days 70,000 people were marching to oppose the Governor\u2019s budget.\nProtests were also well-coordinated with progressive and Democratic legislators. Three days after protests began, fourteen senate Democrats fled the state of Wisconsin to deny the GOP a quorum. This bought political space and time in addition to the literal space and time that had been seized in the capitol building.\nAdditionally, the occupation focused attention and support by connecting with other movements and national progressive media networks. The Egyptian revolution was in full flower at the time and lent energy and inspiration to the Wisconsin encampment. Protesters carried Egyptian flags, and several Egyptian revolutionaries sent support in the form of pizzas ordered from local business to be delivered to the capitol. Solidarity pizzas then rolled in from across the world. The occupation was also one of the first to use continuous livestreaming to document itself.\nEventually, Governor Walker\u2019s legislation was passed in a legally suspect parliamentary gambit, and the occupation forces switched to an electoral recall strategy.\n\nBy Duncan Meisel","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/wisconsin-capitol-occupation\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Wisconsin Capitol Occupation\/CA_Wisconsin Capitol Occupation_signs.jpg","links":[104127,100146,100143,201558,200222,200237,200182,200131,200153,300243,300257,300179,100138,100245,100149,100173,100161,200248,200132,200219,200238,200260,200212,200232,200189,200220,300259,300204,300205]},{"id":400194,"type":3,"title":"Whose Tea Party?","text":"Two Republican Congressmen, Dick Armey from Texas and Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, have come to Boston to promote their snake oil proposals for a flat tax and national sales tax, two initiatives that would dramatically shift the tax burden off the wealthy and onto low- and moderate-income working families.

With the cameras rolling, they step up to the railing of the Tea Party boat, ready to heave forth an enormous trunk containing the tax code.\nSuddenly, two protesters from United for a Fair Economy, a Boston-based NGO working for greater economic equality, paddle into sight in a small dinghy. One of them is in a hard hat, the other clutching a plastic baby doll. They paddle the precarious \u201cWorking Family Life Raft\u201d into position directly below where Armey and Tauzin are standing and plead, \u201cYour flat tax will sink the working family!\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ll drown us with your sales tax!\u201d Other UFE protesters, who have snuck onto the Tea Party ship and are dressed in fancy suits and dresses, start egging on the Congressmen, chanting, \u201cSink \u2019em with the sales tax!\u201d and \u201cDrown \u2019em with the flat tax!\u201d\nArmey and Tauzin stand paralyzed on the boat. Their handlers go into a panic as UFE staff approach the media with press releases, explaining the symbolism of the protest and offering evidence of how both the flat tax and the national sales tax will sink working families.\nFinally, not knowing what else to do, they throw the tax code trunk into the harbor, swamping the fragile life raft and plunging UFE Education Director Chris Hartman, UFE financial manager Kristin Barralli, and plastic baby doll Veronica into Boston Harbor.\nTheir media stunt hijacked out from under them, Representatives Tauzin and Armey retreat to their limousine, which is now surrounded by cheering members of the Rich People\u2019s Liberation Front, a UFE theater group, holding signs reading, \u201cWe love you Armey and Tauzin!\u201d \u201cTax cuts for us, not our maids,\u201d \u201cFree the Forbes 400,\u201d and \u201cRich folks love the flat tax!\u201d\nQuickly, images of the upended Working Families Life Raft are broadcast around the planet through hourly runs on CNN and other networks.

Typical of many large cities, segregation along ethnic and class lines still often determines where people live and how they navigate the city. It is common for people living in one neighborhood to know very little about, or to never have traveled to, adjacent areas of the city.\nCoolidge Corner in Brookline and Dudley Square in Roxbury are hubs of their respective communities. Brookline has a large Jewish population that migrated in the 1960s from the Dudley area in Roxbury, so there\u2019s a historical connection. Roxbury is now a black and\u00a0Latino neighborhood. Despite being just over two miles apart and connected by a city bus, people living in these neighborhoods rarely visit the other.\nVirtual Streetcorners was a public art installation inviting people to close that gap and experience the city in a new way. Using technology developed to bridge much larger geographical distances, the project\u00a0instead traversed the social boundaries that separate two neighborhoods.\nThroughout the month of June 2010, large glass storefronts in both neighborhoods were transformed into giant video screens providing pedestrians at each location a portal into the others\u2019 world. Running 24\/7, these life-size screen images and AV technology facilitated real-time interaction between residents of the two communities. A passerby could look into the window in one location and see out the window in the other, and be able to converse with whomever might\u00a0be standing there.\nIn addition to spontaneous interactions, there were many programmed activities. Local politicians \u2014 from city councilors to former presidential nominee Michael Dukakis \u2014 joined artists, educators, activists and religious leaders in street corner dialogues on a range of issues. Citizen journalists were hired to come to the screens and deliver daily news reports about what was happening in each neighborhood.\nThe project generated a great deal of excitement and attracted a wide range of participants. Ironically in this era of technology, people treated it as something magical when it was simply a street corner from across town appearing in the window. Many found it entertaining to connect in this way. Others used the opportunity to tackle more philosophical or sociopolitical issues. \u201cThere was an odd sense of safety in talking with someone I had never met,\u201d said one participant. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the virtuality of the whole thing\u00a0emboldened us to say things we\u2019d never say if we simply sat next to each other on a bus.\u201d\n\nBy John Ewing","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/virtual-streetcorners\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Virtual Streetcorners\/CA_Virtual Streetcorners_Bus ad.jpg","links":[200229,200130,200158,300140,200232,200180,300261,300203,300204,300287,300209]},{"id":400157,"type":3,"title":"Trail of Dreams","text":"On January 1, 2010, four immigrant youth leaders (Carlos Roa, Felipe Matos, Juan Rodriguez and myself) embarked on a 1,500 mile walk from Miami, Florida to Washington, D.C.

The long-term goal of this arduous journey was to put a human face on the immigration debate and counteract the effect of anti-immigrant portrayals in the mainstream media. The short-term goal was to put pressure on Washington to fix a failed system that has kept millions of undocumented members of our communities and families in the shadows.\nWe had four requests. The first was for President Obama, through an executive action, to stop the detentions and deportations of students for two years and halt removal proceedings for people with immediate family members who are U.S. citizens. The second was the passage of the DREAM Act (\u201cDevelopment, Relief and Education for Alien Minors\u201d) to allow access to higher education. Third, protection of immigrant workers\u2019 rights, and last, the passage of just and humane immigration reform.\nAt the core of the Trail of Dreams trek was the desire to escalate our activism by publicly sharing stories and struggles, inspiring others to take up similar actions throughout the United States. The goal was to open hearts and change minds in order to create much-needed policy change. Over four months we walked through Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, finally arriving in Washington, D.C., on May 1. Each day we walked sixteen to eighteen miles. Every encounter was an opportunity to share our story, to plant a seed.\nWith the help of hosting communities, we held events where we broke bread and invited people to share their stories, and to organize and fight for their dreams. We were weclcomed by congregations from various faiths, including the Lutherans, Unitarian Universalists, United Methodists, Christ Churchers, Catholics, Baptists and others. We spoke to crowds of white conservatives, conducted a joint event with African-Americans in Georgia, and of course reached out to the Latino base, immigrants and citizens alike. The trek would have not been possible without the support of a small but dedicated group, including a project manager, a logistics coordinator, a driver and an on-site coordinator. Our organization, Students Working for Equal Rights, set up local teams along the route to ensure our safety and well-being.\nWe faced many challenges.

Thirty-four heads of state from across the Americas were gathering in Qu\u00e9bec City to negotiate the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), a sweeping trade deal with deeply anti-democratic provisions. Protests had been called, tens of thousands were expected to fill the streets, and a giant fence defended by thousands of riot police was to be erected around the Old City to keep protesters far from the convention center.\nAs the summit drew closer and heated debates raged in activist circles about how to oppose the FTAA most effectively, a group calling themselves the Deconstructionist Institute for Surreal Topology (DIST) circulated a satirical booklet promoting more creative protest tactics: \u201cFor those who yawn every time they see yet another Black Bloc, the Deconstructionist Institute for Surreal Topology presents this brief list of alternatives, to help spark discussion and inject a bit of creativity and derisive laughter into the mix.\u201d\nTheir list of protest ideas included the Gary Coleman Bloc (tactic of choice: continuously walking up to cops and demanding, \u201cWhatchu talkin\u2019 bout, Willis?\u201d), the Mascot Bloc, the Bloc Parents and the Fuchsia Bloc (\u201cdressed in tights and pink tutus, the Fuchsia Bloc\u2019s role is to follow the Black Bloc and tease them mercilessly\u201d). DIST also jokingly proposed challenging the fence around the conference area with a Monty-Pythonesque Medieval Bloc: \u201cIf the man is gonna turn the summit into a fortress, the Medieval Bloc will lay siege with gusto. Beautiful battering rams, ladders, siege towers, Trojan donuts, catapults, and dead cows infected with the plague.\u201d\nIt was a good laugh, but seemingly nothing more \u2014 until a public figure sympathetic to the cause contacted the group and said, \u201cif you can find someone to build a catapult, I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d A group of catapult enthusiasts in Ottawa agreed to build the prop (rigged to ensure it couldn\u2019t launch anything very far on the off-chance it was actually taken for a weapon), and DIST smuggled it into the city. On the day of the march, activists with pots and colanders on their heads pulled the full-size catapult up to the fence and began gently lobbing teddy bears into lines of riot cops. Meanwhile, other activists dismantled the offending fence with bolt-cutters as cameras rolled.\nThe stunt complete, the activists disabled the prop and abandoned it to the police who were advancing through clouds of tear gas. Everyone thought that would be the end of it, but the police couldn\u2019t bear to be outflanked on the absurdist front: they retaliated by sending plainclothes officers to snatch a prominent activist, Jaggi Singh, who had had nothing to do with the catapult, and charge him with possession of a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d: the prop itself. Singh was held for seventeen days before being released.\nThe spurious weapons charge only added fuel to DIST\u2019s fire, setting off a whole new round of press releases and media stunts mocking the security establishment, with activists turning in their \u201cstuffed comrades\u201d (i.e. teddy bears) to local police stations across the country and sending them to the Canadian Prime Minister\u2019s office to protest the absurd charge.\n\nBy Dave Oswald Mitchell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/the-teddy-bear-catapult\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Teddy Bear Catapult\/CA_Teddy Bear Catapult_Confiscation.jpg","links":[200526,200223,200130,200211,300140,300209,300287,100149,100138,100226,100234,200220,200231,200212,200182,200233,200255,200132,300208,300202,300263,300141,500313]},{"id":400256,"type":3,"title":"Tar sands action","text":"Because tar sands oil emits four times the carbon dioxide as standard crude, renowned climate scientist James Hanson has declared that if the Canadian tar sands were fully developed, it would be \u201cessentially game over for the climate.\u201d Seeking to draw a line in the (tar) sands, activists successfully organized&nbsp; &nbsp;...Continue Reading Because tar sands oil emits four times the carbon dioxide as standard crude, renowned climate scientist James Hanson has declared that if the Canadian tar sands were fully developed, it would be \u201cessentially game over for the climate.\u201d Seeking to draw a line in the (tar) sands, activists successfully organized to delay, and possibly stop, TransCanada\u2019s plans to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried 800,000 barrels a day of tar sands oil to Texas refineries. As of this writing it is unclear if the project will re-emerge in another form, but the movement is girding to defeat any attempted resurrection.\nIndigenous communities in northern Alberta, Canada, have been organizing to stop tar sands expansion for decades, and while many U.S. environmental groups began to join the fight around 2007, they had a hard time popularizing the issue in the United States. This changed in June 2011, when a group of prominent authors, scientists, Indigenous leaders, and activists, spearheaded by Bill McKibben, released a joint letter calling\u00a0on climate activists to participate in two weeks of daily non-violent direct action at the White House in Washington, D.C.\nThe action quickly became a rallying point for activists working on climate change issues. From August 20 to September 3, 1,253 farmers, teachers, mothers, scientists, celebrities, Indigenous elders, faith leaders and students were arrested outside the White House, garnering international media attention and galvanizing the environmental movement\u2019s opposition to the pipeline.\nBecause building the Keystone XL pipeline required a Presidential Permit to go ahead, organizers chose to target President Obama as the focus of the action see PRINCIPLE: Choose your target wisely, see THEORY: Points of intervention. Activists were clear to distinguish between Obama as the target and TransCanada as the enemy. This distinction yielded a tone that was assertive but friendly. Even as the campaign interrupted his public speeches, flooded campaign offices and staged mass arrests, the emphasis was always on Obama\u2019s campaign promises to \u201cend the tyranny of oil\u201d and slow the rise of the oceans. By repeating his own words back to him, activists framed the issue in such a way that Obama had both a serious liability and a huge opportunity on his hands: he could side with the people, or with the polluters.\nOf all the tactics employed on the campaign, Obama officials said they were rattled most by \u201cbird-doging\u201d interruptions at high-priced fundraisers because these actions eroded the confidence of Obama\u2019s key financial backers. Even in disruptive actions, the message was always inviting, remixing Obama\u2019s own messaging: \u201cPresident Obama, Yes You Can Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline.\u201d The goal was to emphasize the political risks of alienating his environmentalist and climate-conscious base. This risk was further amplified by protests around the world, including a mass arrestable sit-in at the Canadian parliament.\nBuilding on this momentum, a second invitation to action was issued, this time for thousands of people to surround the White House on November 6, one year before the next presidential election. This event brought 12,000 people to Obama\u2019s front door and showcased a wide segment of the environmental movement, from Indigenous leaders to Nebraska ranchers to college students. Four days later, President Obama sent the pipeline back for a full 18-month re-review. In response, Republicans in Congress legislatively forced an accelerated timeline for approval, which led to the president choosing to outright deny the rushed permit. This was a definitive victory against the pipeline, and while TransCanada can still reapply \u2014 forcing us to fight the battle again, it reminds us that most environmental victories are temporary on their own, and require continued organizing and pressure (alongside systemic change) to remain durable.\n\nBy Duncan Meisel and Joshua Kahn Russell","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/tar-sands-action\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/tar-sands.jpg","links":[200222,200131,200132,200153,300140,300204,300179,300287,100149,100161,100138,200137,200181,200154,200269,200211,200237,200134,300208]},{"id":400196,"type":3,"title":"Taco Bell boycott","text":"For years, workers in Florida\u2019s tomato fields have endured poverty wages and terrible working conditions.

In 1993, a small, community-based organization called the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) formed to demand an end to these unfair labor practices. By 2005, they had won a boycott campaign against Taco Bell, one of the largest fast-food corporations in the world, raising wages by almost seventy-five percent and setting an inspiring precedent for farm worker organizing.\nThe Coalition of Immokalee Workers began by developing a list of concrete demands that, if met, would realize their vision of social justice in the fields. These were later refined into \u201cfair food principles\u201d which would bring tangible benefits to their base, and were sufficiently clear that the workers could know whether or not they had succeeded in their campaign.\nOnce they had established their goals, the CIW identified tomato growers as the group that had the power to give them what they wanted. The CIW fought a well-organized campaign targeting the growers, engaging in three community-wide work stoppages and a high-profile hunger strike. The CIW was able to win the first wage increase in twenty years, but wages were still well below the poverty level. They realized that they, the workers alone, did not have the power to force their target to capitulate, so they looked for another target.\nThe CIW identified the corporations that bought from the growers, including Taco Bell, as a secondary target. Taco Bell\u2019s success, unlike that of the growers, depended on its public image. The CIW also identified potential allies that could help them put pressure on their target. They reached out to students, because Taco Bell targeted them as consumers. They also allied themselves with social justice-oriented religious groups.\nIn 2001, the CIW launched the boycott of Taco Bell, calling on the fast-food giant to take responsibility for human rights violations in their supply chain, to improve wages and working conditions by passing on a penny-per-pound pay increase to the workers, and to buy only from Florida growers who passed this penny per pound payment on to the farm workers.\nThe CIW-led campaign organized cross-country caravans that held rallies outside Taco Bell restaurants; students organized petitions to \u201cBoot the Bell\u201d from campus food courts; religious, labor and community leaders were approached to publicly endorse the boycott and further isolate Taco Bell from support; and they directly targeted Taco Bell headquarters with public hunger strikes and marches.\nAfter four years of actions by the CIW and their allies, Taco Bell conceded. The boycott win was an unqualified victory.\u00a0 All demands were met, including the first-ever ongoing, direct payment to farm workers, substantially raising their wages, and an enforceable code of conduct. The agreement was a clear victory for the workers who struggled for it against an intransigent target, and helped bring renewed energy to the fair-food movement.\n\nBy Yutaka Dirks","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/taco-bell-boycott\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE STUDY Taco Bell Boycott\/CS_Taco Bell Boycott_buckets.jpg","links":[100143,200232,200237,200131,200220,200137,200153,200183,300209,300204,300205,100171,100138,200270,200182,200154,300261,300263,500308,400163]},{"id":400185,"type":3,"title":"Streets into gardens","text":"In the spring of 1999, real estate values in New York\u2019s East Village and Lower East Side neighborhoods were skyrocketing, in no small part due to the beautiful network of communitygardens in the area.

In a massive giveaway to corporate developers, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced he would auction off 198 community gardens. Gardeners and their supporters began organizing to stop it from happening.\nOn a gray and quiet Saturday afternoon weeks before the auction, two \u201ctripod teams\u201d were anxiously milling about on Avenue A in the East Village, anticipating the arrival of a boisterous crowd assembling several blocks away. All the constituent parts of the tripod, along with several plant boxes and other sundry items, had been stashed in strategic and discrete locations along the sidewalk.\nMeanwhile, the diverse and growing crowd was in the garden finishing its face-painting, elf-costuming and other preparations. Lace-winged children and leaf-adorned stilt-walkers made their way into the street. The brass notes of trombones, tubas and saxophones rang out as the throng of garden protectors proceeded westward along 7th Street and turned the corner onto Avenue A. When the crowd arrived, the teams quickly erected the tripods. The designated \u201cperchers\u201d quickly ascended the rope that hung from the center and installed themselves in the cradle formed at the top. Traffic was thus effectively and immediately shut down. Marchers dragged the plant boxes into the street, gave packages of seeds to the children and began teaching them how to make roses grow. With a bit of rope and some ingenuity, others were able to turn several misplaced police barricades into a seesaw. Beautifully wrapped packages were opened to the delight of all as the crowd, which had been asked to bring gifts to share, bestowed one another with presents. A sound crew wheeled a massive set of speakers into the street and began broadcasting a pirate radio signal that was transmitting from a nearby apartment. Dancing began in earnest, and the crowd soon swelled to 300, then 400, then 500.\nFor the next several hours, a city block became the sort of public space that Giuliani was planning to eliminate by selling the gardens. One banner above all others summed up the driving logic of the action: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to pave over the places where we play, then we will play in the places they\u2019ve paved over.\u201d The frame stuck, and was repeated in the mainstream media that night and the next day. By the time the auction was scheduled to take place, public sentiment had shifted strongly against the mayor on this issue. He was ultimately forced to stop the auction and sell the gardens to private land trusts instead of greedy developers, and all of the gardens were preserved in perpetuity.\n\nBy Mark Read","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/streets-into-gardens\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Streets into Gardens\/CS_Streets into Gardens_Reclaim.jpg","links":[100149,204970,200225,200255,200182,200154,300176,300258,100138,100239,200132,200189,200130,200220,300141,300287,300208,400236]},{"id":400252,"type":3,"title":"Stolen Beauty boycott campaign","text":"A group of American and Israeli women enter the Ahava cosmetics shop in the Tel Aviv Hilton.

The message is in the mud: there is nothing beautiful about occupation.\nStolen Beauty seeks to educate consumers, store managers, CEOs, and the general public about Ahava\u2019s illegal practices. Our tactics range from guerrilla theater to online culture jamming. We target Ahava \u2014 its location in an illegal settlement, its fraudulent labeling, and its illegal pillaging of mud from the shores of occupied lands \u2014 as a poster child of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip. By drawing attention to Ahava\u2019s settlement products, we educate the American and global public on what is really happening in the occupied West Bank, contributing to the much larger international campaign of boycotts, divestment and sanctions calling on the Israeli government to respect international law and Palestinian rights.\nSoon after the launch of the campaign, we discover that Sex and the City star Kristin Davis is both Ahava\u2019s spokes-model and an Oxfam Goodwill Ambassador. Our boycott supporters contact Oxfam, which has an explicit policy against Israeli settlement products. Oxfam suspends Davis from publicity work for the duration of her Ahava contract. The story lands in the gossip column of the New York Post; terrible publicity for Ahava, but good for fans of justice and peace. Davis does not renew her contract with the company.\nNext, Ahava announces a Twitter contest for free products. We issue a call to Tweet in messages like: \u201cDoes AHAVA offer a moisturizer to sooth my hands after so much ethnic cleansing?\u201d We culture jam their marketing contest, turning it into a #socialmediafail.\nCreative interventions continue to target points of intervention such as stores that carry Ahava\u2019s products see THEORY: Points of intervention.

On acceptance of the envelope, they become part of the conversation, and decide for themselves whether or how they will spend the pound, and whether they will return to the table. If they do return with something to offer, they are invited to use their conversation-starter question to meet new people, and can partake of whatever is on the table at that time.\nThis intervention is typical of the small gifts series in that it asks the participant to determine what he\/she takes from the experience, guided only by a series of simple conversation starters and whatever is being shared on the table.

Before too long, security guards and shop assistants interrupted the magic, desperately tearing the presents out of people\u2019s hands.

With widely distributed photos of Santa Claus getting beaten for being too generous, the action was a hit.\nThe people behind Santa\u2019s beards were the Danish theater collective Solvognen (\u201cThe Sun Chariot,\u201d an allusion to Norse mythology).

Mahatma Gandhi was appointed to develop a plan of action; he proposed marching to the sea to make salt in defiance of the Salt Act of 1882. Violation of the Salt Act, which made it illegal for anyone to collect or produce salt except for authorized British nationals, did not immediately catch the imagination of the delegates, and was reportedly met with some laughter in the Congress. The Raj (as the British empire in India was known) did not take this idea as much of a threat either. Viceroy Lord Irwin actually wrote back to London to report, \u201cAt present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.\u201d[1]\nThis would soon change, however, as the salt march, which began with about eighty men, quickly gathered supporters on its way to the Indian Ocean. Gandhi framed the 240-mile march from his ashram to the sea within a traditional cultural practice known as the padyatra (a long spiritual march). Not only did this help make the whole program more understandable to the Indian public, it opened up the possibility to do outreach, gather more supporters, educate and provide training, and work the national and international press. Advance teams worked the route and followers slept out in the open in each town to be more accessible.\nWhen he and more than 12,000 supporters finally reached the sea, the day chosen to make salt was the ten-year anniversary of the first round of national resistance actions. The British were slow to react at first, allowing more Indians to join in the protest. As salt making spread, and the British responded brutally, the empire\u2019s facade of civility slipped and then fell away entirely.\n\n\n\t[1] Peter Ackerman and Jack Duvall, A Force More Powerful (New York, NY: Palgrave, 200), 84 &#x21A9;\nBy Nadine Bloch","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/the-salt-march\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Salt March\/CA_Salt March_Gandhi.jpg","links":[100239,100171,100138,100149,200526,200222,200181,200241,200130,200154,200219,200132,200180,200153,300140,300169,300204,300176,300287,100191,100148,200231,200269,200270,200182,200238,200137,300259,300202,300208,300192]},{"id":400236,"type":3,"title":"Reclaim the Streets","text":"Reclaim the Streets (RTS) began as creative activist group in London, but its tactics, blending party and protest, soon spread around the world.

Using rave culture tactics, the location was kept secret until the last moment, and participants were led from a public meeting point through the subway to emerge at the party site before the police had time to gather forces.\nThe event began with two cars crashing into each other. The drivers jumped out in theatrical road rage and began to destroy each other\u2019s vehicles with hammers. Meanwhile, 500 people emerged from the subway station into the traffic-free street that the crashed cars had blocked, and started the party, dancing, sharing free food and meeting new friends.\nFrom 1995-98, street parties evolved in complexity and scale. Creative techniques ranged from tons of sand dumped in the road to create a sand box, to tripods made from scaffolding erected in the middle of the street with someone sitting on top. These \u201cintelligent\u201d barricades blocked the road from cars and yet opened it for pedestrians.\nIn the summer of 1996, 8,000 participants took over a motorway while huge carnival figures with hooped skirts moved amongst them. Underneath the skirts, hidden from view, activists drilled into the tarmac with jack hammers and planting saplings into the motorway. This story took on the power of a myth as it circulated on the early threads of the world wide web. It even inspired striking longshoremen from Liverpool to make common cause with RTS, proof that imagination can break down barriers of class and political\/ cultural difference.\nThe RTS meme soon spread across the UK and the Western world. A global street party in seventy cities occurred in May 1998, coinciding with the G8 summit. A year later, a \u201cCarnival Against Capital\u201d on June 18th, coordinated by RTS and the People\u2019s Global Action network, saw simultaneous actions in financial districts across the world, from Nigeria to Uruguay, Seoul to Melbourne, Belarus to Dhaka. Six months after that, a carnivalesque mass street action shut down the WTO in Seattle, an event that proved to be the coming-out party for the anti-globalization movement.\n\nBy John Jordan","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/reclaim-the-streets\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Reclaim the Streets\/CA_Reclaim the Streets_RTS Dance Party.jpg","links":[105009,100138,100148,100149,204970,200222,200223,200189,300141,300205,300176,300258,300192,100193,100239,200238,200229,200242,200130,200227,300208,300228,300235,400185,500381]},{"id":400151,"type":3,"title":"Public Option Annie","text":"By the fall of 2009, with Sarah Palin tweeting about \u201cdeath panels\u201d and town hall meetings overrun by angry teabaggers up in arms (literally) about a supposed \u201cgovernment takeover of healthcare,\u201d progressives had officially lost control of the healthcare debate.

Could a daring creative action that brought the fight directly to the insurance industry help reframe the conversation and shift momentum back toward reform? One group of activists centered around a small \u201csubvertising\u201d agency called Agit-Pop, certainly thought so.\nWorking closely with the main healthcare reform coalition, we snuck a handful of professional singers and stealth videographers into a high-profile gathering of insurance industry lobbyists. With fake name tags and business suits, we blended in with the crowd and, just as the closing keynote began, let loose with a \u201cguerrilla musical\u201d complete with soloists, chorus and comic asides. Dubbed \u201cPublic Option Annie,\u201d and set to the tune of Annie\u2019s \u201cTomorrow,\u201d it by turn surprised, charmed and irritated the assembled lobbyists until security escorted everyone out. Within two hours we had turned the footage and audio into a polished viral video, loaded it onto YouTube and shopped it around to media outlets.\nRachel Maddow ran a glowing segment on it that same night, calling it \u201cthe single most unexpected turn of events yet in the fight over health reform.\u201d It was then picked up by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer and numerous local TV stations. The blogosphere lit up, reform supporters cheered, and Jon Stewart picked up the story, mocking the \u201cterrible\u201d singing for blowing out his eardrums.\nThat same week the public option made it into the Senate bill.

Fed up with the state of Danish politics, the students constructed an absurd political position, ironically claiming that the nihilism within religion and science had spread into the political sphere: \u201cAll Danes are nihilists. We have no values except our flat-screen TVs. Holding other values is considered religious extremism. The Nihilist Democratic Party, therefore, is the answer to the democratic deficit that we have witnessed up until now,\u201d the party\u2019s chairman and candidate for mayor of Copenhagen, Mads Vestergaard, explained in one of the NDP\u2019s videos.\nThe party ran a full campaign in the 2009 local elections, promising such things as psychedelically painted subway tunnels (why should a subway ride be boring?), tax exemption on drugs and alcohol (the death rate stays at 100% anyway, so we might as well have some fun), and the production of a \u201ccuteness canon\u201d that would list all animals deemed cute enough for state-guaranteed protection and care \u2014 a reference to a heated debate about the government\u2019s production of a \u201cnational culture canon\u201d and to the fact that the extreme right wing in Denmark is obsessed with the needs of animals while comfortably ignoring those of immigrants.\nThe NDP\u2019s platform ironically addressed a number of divisive issues. For example, it promoted an aggressive international security policy \u2014 not to defend Danish democracy, but to protect the Danes from people with \u201cactual values\u201d (such as Muslims). They were opposed to work per se as it aids the government in hiding \u201cthe metaphysical fact that life is pointless and completely void of meaning.\u201d And they strongly opposed any set of cultural policies, considering culture and art an unwarranted escape from a meaningless existence. Only sports should be funded as they accurately represent the meaninglessness of life, one team or player fighting another for the sake of pointless scores.\nThe campaign provoked both delight and skepticism. Since the NDP always stayed in character and never admitted to being a hoax, some people, including noted intellectuals, criticized the project on its own terms. For most people, though, the party simply spiced up an otherwise predictable election period. On the popular talk show \u201cGood morning Denmark,\u201d the NDP won a poll based on the viewers\u2019 text-messaged votes. Yet in the elections, NDP collected \u201conly\u201d around 4,500 votes (out of 2.8 million). Not enough to get into office \u2014 but enough to get into the spotlight. Thus, activists managed to deliver a critique of a political sphere riddled with empty pledges and spin much more effectively than had they been writing op-ed articles or otherwise made use of regular channels for citizens to present their views.\n\nBy Elisabeth Ginsberg and Simon Roel","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/the-nihilist-democratic-party\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/NDP.jpg","links":[100218,200212,100184,100234,100226,100239,100177,200526,200255,200126,200231,200158,200199,200134,300208,300140,300142,300206]},{"id":400163,"type":3,"title":"Modern-Day Slavery Museum","text":"In December 2008, farm labor contractors Cesar and Geovanni Navarrete were each sentenced to twelve years in prison for their part in what U.S. Attorney Doug Molloy called \u201cslavery, plain and simple.\u201d According to the Justice Department, the employers \u201cpleaded guilty to beating, threatening, restraining, and locking workers in trucks&nbsp; &nbsp;...Continue Reading In December 2008, farm labor contractors Cesar and Geovanni Navarrete were each sentenced to twelve years in prison for their part in what U.S. Attorney Doug Molloy called \u201cslavery, plain and simple.\u201d According to the Justice Department, the employers \u201cpleaded guilty to beating, threatening, restraining, and locking workers in trucks to force them to work as agricultural laborers\u2026 [They] were accused of paying the workersminimal wages and driving the workers into debt, while simultaneously threatening physical harm if the workers left their employment before their debts had been repaid to the Navarrete family.\u201d\nAlthough shocking in its details, the Navarrete case was simply the latest link in a long, unbroken chain of exploitation \u2014 including forced labor \u2014 in Florida\u2019s fields. It was the seventh farm labor operation to be prosecuted for servitude in the state in the past decade, cases involving well over 1,000 workers and more than a dozen employers in total. The federal government has since initiated two additional prosecutions, bringing the total to nine as of 2011.\nEven setting aside forced labor, farm work in the U.S. still offers the worst combination of sub-poverty wages, dangerous, backbreaking working conditions, and lack of fundamental labor protections. In this context of structural poverty and powerlessness, extreme forms of abuse such as forced labor are able to take root and flourish. However these cases are reflective of the impunity and exploitation that is rampant throughout the agricultural sector. In other words, modern-day slavery does not take place in a vacuum, nor is it an inevitable feature of our food system.\nTo highlight these abuses and to identify their causes and solution, in 2010 the Coalition of Immokalee Workers \u2014 a community-based farmworker organization \u2014 decided to create the Florida Modern-Day Slavery Museum. The mobile museum consists of a cargo truck carefully outfitted as a replica of the trucks involved in the Navarrete case and a collection of displays on the history and evolution of slavery in Florida over the past four hundred years. The multimedia exhibits were developed in consultation with workers who have escaped from forced labor operations, as well as leading academic authorities on slavery and labor history in Florida.\nWith a team of farmworker and ally docents, the museum toured Florida intensively, visiting churches, schools, universities and community centers for six weeks in the lead-up to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers\u2019 three-day Farmworker Freedom March in 2010.\nPeople\u2019s reactions to the museum were so overwhelmingly positive and such a buzz was generated that the CIW later decided to tour outside Florida to cities throughout the Southeast and Northeast, including a stop on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In March 2011, former President Jimmy Carter visited the museum in Atlanta, Georgia. Approximately 10,000 people have toured the museum since its creation.\n\nBy coalitionofimmokaleeworkers","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/modern-day-slavery-museum\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Florida Modern Slavery Museum\/ModernSlavery2.jpg","links":[200264,200154,200220,300214,200232,200182,200130,200247,400196,500308]},{"id":400267,"type":3,"title":"Mining the museum","text":"In 1992, a huge sign was hanging from the fa\u00e7ade of the Maryland Historical Society announcing that \u201canother\u201d history was now being told inside.

The sign referred to African-American artist Fred Wilson\u2019s exhibition project \u201cMining the Museum,\u201d which presented the museum\u2019s collection in a new, critical light.\nIncorporated in 1844, the Maryland Historical Society was founded to collect, preserve, and study objects related to the state\u2019s history. This mission included accounts of colonization, slavery and abolition, but the museum tended to present this history from a specific viewpoint, namely that of the its white male founding board. It was this worldview that Wilson aimed to \u201cmine.\u201d He did so simply by assembling the museum\u2019s collection in a new and surprising way, deploying various satirical techniques, first and foremost irony.\nFor instance, in the first room of the exhibit, the audience was confronted with a silver globe \u2014 an advertising industry award given at clubs in the first half of the century \u2014 bearing the single word \u201cTruth.\u201d The trophy was flanked by, on the one side, a trio of portrait busts of prominent white men and, on the other side, three empty black pedestals. The busts were of Napoleon, Henry Clay, and Andrew Jackson. None of these worthies had ever lived in Maryland; they exemplified those deemed deserving of sculptural representation and subsequent museum acquisition. The empty busts were labeled Harriet Tubman, Benjamin Banneker, and Frederick Douglass, three important African-American Marylanders who were overlooked by the ostensibly \u201clocal\u201d institution.\n\u201cWhat they put on view says a lot about a museum, but what they don\u2019t put on view says even more,\u201d[1] Wilson said in an interview about his installations. He communicated this point by contrasting what is with what should be. By drawing attention to the overlooked black figures, his installment asked whose truth was on display at the Maryland Historical Society.\nThe installation \u201cMetalwork 1793\u20131880\u201d was another way that Wilson reshuffled the museum\u2019s collection to highlight the history of African Americans. The installation juxtaposed ornate silver pitchers, flacons, and teacups with a pair of iron slave shackles. Traditionally, the display of arts and craft is kept separate from the display of traumatic artifacts such as slave shackles. By displaying these artifacts side by side, Wilson created an atmosphere of unease and made apparent the link between the two kinds of metal works: The production of the one was made possible by the subjugation enforced by the other. When the audience made this connection, Wilson succeeded in creating awareness of the biases that often underlie historical exhibitions and, further, the way these biases shape the meaning we attach to what we are viewing.\n\n\n\t[1] Coco Fusco, \u201cThe Other History of Intercultural Performance,\u201d TDR: Journal of\u00a0Performance Studies 38, no. 1 (Spring 1994): 148. &#x21A9;\nBy Elisabeth Ginsberg","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/mining-the-museum\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/pots.jpg","links":[100177,200154,100184,200182,200264,200220,200158,200199,200130,300243,300206,300261]},{"id":400197,"type":3,"title":"Harry Potter Alliance","text":"In 2005, I was amazed by the Harry Potter fan-phenomenon.

The franchise was the highest selling work of fiction in the history of literature. It cut across cultures. Besides the Koran, it was the most requested book in the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison. Fans invested enormous resources into conferences, wrote reams of fan fiction, started Quidditch sports leagues and tournaments and birthed an entire genre of music: Wizard Rock, with literally hundreds of bands, all singing about Harry Potter.\nAnd yet, I was frustrated.\n\u201cIf Harry Potter were in our world,\u201d I realized, \u201che\u2019d do more than talk about Harry Potter.

I wanted to create a Dumbledore\u2019s Army in our own world that could wake our media and governments to stop global warming and end genocide in Darfur. By tapping into a teenager\u2019s narrative connection to Harry Potter, such an organization could create a fun and accessible point of entry into what could otherwise be intimidating social issues.\nIn mid-2005, I met up with Harry and the Potters, two brothers, both indie rock musicians who dress as Harry Potter and sing wildly popular punk songs at concerts with audiences in the hundreds and sometimes thousands. Together, we and a few others founded the Harry Potter Alliance: a \u201cnovel\u201d approach to activism, and began using social media to organize the Harry Potter fanbase. Harry and the Potters reposted my action alerts to their 60,000 followers. Soon, other Wizard Rock bands were reposting the alerts. The biggest fan sites, like The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet, caught on and media coverage followed, with J. K. Rowling praising the group in Time magazine and on her own site. Soon the HPA was organizing amongst almost every facet of the Harry Potter fandom, and grew to seventy volunteer staff and over ninety chapters around the world.\nTo date, the HPA has sent five cargo planes of relief supplies to Haiti, donated 90,000 books to needy communities and schools across the world, and has made strides in advocating for human rights, LGBTQ equality, media reform and net neutrality.\n\n\nBy Andrew Slack","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/harry-potter-alliance\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE The Harry Potter Alliance\/HP_Harry Potter Alliance_tarmac.jpg","links":[200241,200231,200139,300263,300205,100148,200269,200220,200180,200211,300201,300228,300192,300209,300204,300243]},{"id":400266,"type":3,"title":"Dow Chemical apologizes for Bhopal","text":"On the twentieth anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, when an industrial gas leak killed thousands of people, a spokesperson for the company responsible appeared live on BBC World News and announces the impossible: Dow accepted full responsibility for the Bhopal disaster, and had created a $12 billion dollar plan to&nbsp; &nbsp;...Continue Reading On the twentieth anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, when an industrial gas leak killed thousands of people, a spokesperson for the company responsible appeared live on BBC World News and announces the impossible: Dow accepted full responsibility for the Bhopal disaster, and had created a $12 billion dollar plan to compensate the victims and clean up the site.\nWhen the broadcast ended, the BBC studio technician was beaming. \u201cWhat a nice thing to announce,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t work for Dow if I didn\u2019t believe in it,\u201d he replied.

No problem. Mr. Jude (patron saint of the impossible) Finisterra (earth\u2019s end) became Dow\u2019s official spokesperson.\nWhat to say? We settled on the impossible: Jude would announce a radical new direction for the company, one in which Dow would take full responsibility for the disaster. We would lay out a straightforward ethical path for Dow to follow to compensate the victims, clean up the plant site, and otherwise help make amends for one of the worst industrial disasters in history.

For two years, they travelled through various Western metropolises, presenting themselves as undiscovered Amerindians from an island in the Gulf of Mexico that had somehow been overlooked for five centuries. They called their homeland Guatinau and themselves Guatinauis.\nExhibited in a cage, the couple performed \u201ctraditional tasks,\u201d which ranged from sewing voodoo dolls to watching television. A donation box in front of the cage indicated that for a small fee, the female Guatinaui would perform a traditional dance (to rap music), the male Guatinaui would tell authentic Amerindian stories (in a made-up language), and they would both pose with visitors. At the Whitney Museum in New York, sex was added to the spectacle when visitors were offered a peek at \u201cauthentic Guatinaui male genitals\u201d for five dollars.\nNext to the cage were two official-looking guards ready to answer visitors\u2019 questions, feed the Guatinauis, and take them to the bathroom on leashes. In addition to the authority of the guards, an institutional framework was evoked by didactic panels listing highlights from the history of exhibiting non-Western peoples and a simulated Encyclopedia Britannica entry with a fake map of the Gulf of Mexico showing Guatinau.\nAside from the authority provided by the various museum venues, everything on display was blatantly theatrical and clich\u00e9ed: the Guatinauis had their skulls measured, were fed bananas, and were described as \u201cspecimens,\u201d among other things.\nThe performances were filmed and compiled in a documentary titled The Couple in the Cage: A Guatinaui Odyssey. Whereas the couple was the object on display during the live performance, the audience became the object on display during the documentary. While Fusco and G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a adopted the roles of the caged natives, they were simultaneously scrutinizing the audience\u2019s responses. And what they found was surprising: Despite their intent to create an over-the-top satirical commentary on Western concepts of the exotic, primitive Other, it turned out that a substantial portion of the audience believed in the authenticity of the Guatinauis.\nIn an article about the performance, Fusco argues that the audience\u2019s immediate response reveals their fundamental beliefs: \u201cIn such encounters with the unexpected, people\u2019s defense mechanisms are less likely to operate with their normal efficiency; caught off-guard, their beliefs are more likely to rise to the surface.\u201d[1]\nSeemingly making the same assumption, the documentary presents the audience\u2019s reactions as indirect proof that racist beliefs \u2014 non-Western people are primitive, inferior, and essentially different from Western people \u2014 permeate our postcolonial society. Whether or not this is true, The Couple in the Cage persuasively argues that colonial ideas continue to influence our approach to non-Western cultures.\n\n\n\n\t[1] Coco Fusco, \u201cThe Other History of Intercultural Performance,\u201d TDR: Journal of Performance Studies 38, no. 1 (Spring 1994): 148. &#x21A9;\nBy Elisabeth Ginsberg","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/the-couple-in-the-cage\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/coupleincage.jpg","links":[100234,100177,200154,200231,100207,200526,200134,200130,300287,300140,500331,500333]},{"id":400166,"type":3,"title":"Colbert roasts Bush","text":"Every year, a celebrity, often a comedian, is invited to roast the President at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists who regularly cover the White House and the President.

But it isn\u2019t every year that the President has \u201cthat look that he\u2019s ready to blow,[1]\u201d as an aide of President Bush expressed it after comedian Stephen Colbert delivered his speech in 2006.\nColbert delivered his lines with militant irony, professing to approve of the very things about Bush he was in fact attacking. He satirized a host of topics including the typically Republican opposition to big governments by referencing the war in Iraq: \u201cI believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq,\u201d he said. He then turned to Bush\u2019s decreasing popularity:\nNow, I know there are some polls out there saying that this man has a thirty-two percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don\u2019t pay attention to the polls\u2026 We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in \u201creality.\u201d And reality has a well-known liberal bias.\nWhile Colbert\u2019s mock defense of Bush took up most of the sixteen minute-long speech, he didn\u2019t spare the gathered press corps either: \u201cAs excited as I am to be here with the president, I am appalled to be surrounded by the liberal media that is destroying America. With the exception of Fox News. Fox News gives you both sides of every story: the president\u2019s side, and the vice president\u2019s side,\u201d he said before reviewing \u201cthe rules\u201d:\nHere\u2019s how it works. The president makes decisions. He\u2019s the decider. The press secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down. Make, announce, type. Just put \u2019em through a spell check and go home. Get to know your family again. Make love to your wife. Write that novel you got kicking around in your head. You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the Administration? You know, fiction!\nColbert\u2019s sarcastic performance was broadcast live on the cable network C-SPAN and viewed on YouTube 2.7 million times in the first forty-eight hours after it was posted. By calling to account some of the world\u2019s most powerful people as they sat, grinning uncomfortably, in the camera\u2019s glare, he affirmed his status as someone who speaks \u201ctruthiness\u201d to power.\nIf his intent was of to shame the president and the press into improvement, it\u2019d be hard to call it a success. But judging from online discussions of the speech, a good portion of the public experienced it as an empowering emperor-has-no-clothes moment. Liberal columnist Dan Savage, for example, referred to it as \u201cone of the things that kept people like me sane during the darkest days of the Bush years.[2]\u201d For Bush\u2019s critics, the speech felt like a victory.

And those people may be right. But it is also a highly disciplined army of professional clowns, a militia of authentic fools, a battalion of true buffoons.\nArt activist John Jordan and colleagues L.M. Bogad, Jen Verson and Matt Trevelyan founded CIRCA in late 2003 to welcome arch-clown George W. Bush on his royal visit to London. CIRCA aimed to be a new methodology of civil disobedience, merging the ancient art of clowning with contemporary tactics of nonviolent direct action. It went on to be a successful meme and international protest phenomenon, with self-organized groups taking action in the streets outside summits and military bases in dozens of countries from Colombia to New Zealand.\nCIRCA worked with professional clowns to develop a methodology, rebel clowning, that introduced play and games into the process of political organizing. We developed a series of trainings that encouraged activists to reprogram their bodies, to develop their intuition and to \u201cfind their clown\u201d \u2014 a childlike state of generosity and spontaneity. Rebel clown trainings attempted to peel off the activist armor and find the vulnerable human within.\nEmphasizing the inner work of personal transformation that too many movements ignore, CIRCA viewed both soul and street as sites of struggle. The deep work of clowning, involving real letting go and finding the absolute spontaneous self, can have profoundly liberating psychological effects on participants. CIRCA\u2019s combatants are not meant to pretend to be clowns, they should be real clowns. Clowning is a state of being rather than a technique.\nIt\u2019s a core CIRCA premise that mocking and utterly confusing the enemy can be more powerful than direct confrontation. In one instance, a seventy-person-strong gaggle of clowns walked straight through a line of UK riot cops who, strangely, could not hold their line. When the video footage of the event was examined, it turned out that beneath their visors the cops were laughing too much to be able to concentrate. Other clowns filled their pockets with so much strange junk that it took hours and lots of paper work when stop-and-searches occurred. A favorite tactic was to walk into army recruitment agencies and, in a clownish way, try to join up, thus causing so much chaos that the agencies had to close down for the day, whereupon CIRCA would set up its own shabby recruitment stall outside.\nTurn-of-the-century anarchist Emma Goldman posed this problem: \u201chow to be one\u2019s self and yet in oneness with others, to feel deeply with all human beings and still retain one\u2019s own characteristic qualities.\u201d CIRCA bridged that divide, allowing participants to discover their own inner clown while at the same time wearing a \u201cuniform\u201d that made them feel part of a strongly bonded group.\n\nBy John Jordan","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/clandestine-insurgent-rebel-clown-army\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army\/CA_Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army_plea.jpg","links":[200526,200222,300205,100149,100161,100239,100138,200126,200269,200242,200132,200182,300208,300202,300228,500313,400144]},{"id":400168,"type":3,"title":"Citizen\u2019s Posse","text":"In early spring of 2010, the prospects of the U.S. Congress passing comprehensive health care reform were looking bleak.

The Democrats had caved on the public option, the Blue Dogs were turning red, and Democratic leaders weren\u2019t sure if they had the votes to pass anything.\nMost of the mainstream players in the health care reform movement were busy on Capitol Hill \u201cmaking sausage\u201d while the reform bill grew weaker and less popular by the day. An edgier wing of health care reformers, however, were looking to expand the theater of conflict \u00e0 la Donald Rumsfeld. We had to remind people why reform was needed and we knew that if we could expose the criminal behavior of Big Insurance, they would be convicted in the court of pubic opinion.\nLuckily, a perfect target presented itself. AHIP, the top health insurance lobbying group, decided to bring their chief executives and lobbyists together at a fancy hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., for a summit. They sensed they were close to total victory. They needed to plot out their final moves, smoke their final cigars and cut their final backroom deals.\nHealth Care for America Now (HCAN) \u2014 an alliance of labor unions, the progressive netroots, and a host of community-based organizations \u2014 hired Agit-Pop to help them go big, creative, and militant. Our job was to stage a major street action that would finally tell the story right: Americans want affordable universal health care; insurance companies don\u2019t because they\u2019re profiting from a broken system.\nWe decided to cast the CEOs as organized crime bosses who bribed politicians, denied health care to the critically ill, and ran real Death Panels for profit. We cast participants in the planned rally as a \u201cPeople\u2019s Posse\u201d which would be composed of ordinary people called upon to bring these corporate criminals to justice.\nUnion leaders were skeptical about whether their folks would take to the \u201cposse\u201d frame. But on action day, when their members saw the \u201cCEO Wanted\u201d posters, Citizens\u2019 Posse badges and crime scene tape, they quickly wanted in. Our action had two marches of 1,500 people each converge on the D.C. Ritz Carlton. At that point, we surrounded the building, declared it a crime scene, and posted wanted posters of the CEOs. We had a rally with rousing speeches about corporate criminals, which culminated with William McNary deputizing the crowd by administering the Citizens\u2019 Posse Oath of Office. Then several union presidents and a VIP posse attempted to enter the hotel and make citizens\u2019 arrests. Ten VIP deputies were eventually taken into custody by D.C.\u2019s finest.\nAs a result, the reform movement got a much-needed shot in the arm, and we owned the media cycle for a critical day or two in the homestretch to the vote. The bill (however flawed) eventually passed.\n\nBy John Sellers","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/citizens-posse\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Citizen Posse\/badge-master2.png","links":[100138,100161,200229,200132,300263,300287,100240,100191,100245,100149,200131,200190,200220,200182,201558,200241,200181,300208,300202,300204]},{"id":400144,"type":3,"title":"Billionaires for Bush","text":"\u201cSome people call you the elite,\u201d George W.

Bush joked to his wealthy funders, \u201cI call you my base.\u201d Whether candidate Bush meant it as a joke or not, the Billionaires for Bush (B4B) campaign used humor, street theater and creative media actions to show the country how true the quip was. Working to expose how the Republican Party serves the interests of the super-rich, the Billionaires also addressed the broader issues of economic inequality and corporate greed.\nAn early version of the campaign in 2000, \u201cBillionaires for Bush (or Gore),\u201d had spread virally via the internet and mainstream media exposure. It rebranded itself for the 2004 election, taking as its crusade the defeat of Bush. The New York City chapter took the lead, assembling talented volunteers, among them professional designers, media producers, and actors. It then put the campaign pieces in place. A stylish logo swapped the Republican elephant with a piggy bank stuffed with bills. Satirical slogans \u2014 \u201cRepeal the First Amendment,\u201d \u201cFree the Forbes 400,\u201d \u201cCorporations are people too\u201d \u2014 adorned bumper stickers, buttons, and a slick website, mimicking the look of Bush-Cheney propaganda. A songwriter produced tuneful renditions of what the super-wealthy really think, performed by meticulously rehearsed singers. The members themselves adopted personae, with names and\ncostumes to match, spoofing iconic versions of the .01 percent: the Monopoly-style robber baron (Phil T. Rich), the dim-witted heiress (Alexis Anna Rolls), the trust-fund fuck-up (Monet Oliver D\u2019Place), and so on.\nSoon, the Billionaires could be found talking down to \u201cthe little people\u201d at Bush-Cheney campaign events, left-wing rallies, and street corners.\u00a0 They could also be found all over the mainstream media, garnering thousands of hits, including multiple features in the New York Times and on network and cable TV.\u00a0 Even the chant \u201cWatch more Fox News, then you\u2019ll share our right-wing views!\u201d made it to air\u2026 on Fox News.\nMedia coverage was generated by carefully planned hoaxes, such as the appearance, to a throng of adoring billionaires, of a Karl Rove impostor at a GOP fundraiser. Other times, the campaign outsmarted the authorities to attract the media glare, such as when it held a croquet match on Central Park\u2019s \u201cGreat Lawn,\u201d from which a half-million anti-Bush demonstrators had been banned by New York\u2019s mayor. The media was smitten by the Billionaires\u2019 glamour and charmed by their say-the-opposite-of-what-you-believe theatrics.\nThe campaign was designed to be participatory and national. The core idea was easy both to replicate and embellish. Activists could download the materials they needed to do local actions, while a field organizer helped set up chapters in swing states like Ohio. By late July the hundreds of B4B \u201cbillionaires\u201d from thirty states who showed up to protest at the Republican National Convention far exceeded the number of actual billionaires working hard for their President.\nDeflated by Bush\u2019s victory, the B4B idea nonetheless lived on, generating\u00a0 spin-off campaigns such as Billionaires for Wealthcare, active in the health care debates of 2008-9. Often feeling in 2004 like a clever joke in the wilderness, the campaign in fact anticipated many of the core concerns of Occupy Wall Street and other \u201cGreat Recession\u201d-era activism.\n\nBy Jeremy Varon, Andrew Boyd and Brian Fairbanks","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/billionaires-for-bush\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Billionaires for Bush\/CA_Billionaires for Bush_best.jpg","links":[100184,100177,100226,100148,200241,200229,200189,200231,200211,200133,200129,200139,200126,300204,300263,100127,100138,100234,200134,200270,200135,200130,200158,200154,300228,300208,300201,400167,500356]},{"id":400160,"type":3,"title":"The Big Donor Show","text":"De Grote Donorshow, a hoax TV program presented as\u00a0a reality show, stands as one of the most effective and\u00a0unique public awareness campaigns in recent years.\u00a0The premise of the show was that a terminally ill woman\u00a0would donate her kidney to the most worthy person\u00a0of a group of people needing kidney transplants.&nbsp; &nbsp;...Continue Reading De Grote Donorshow, a hoax TV program presented as\u00a0a reality show, stands as one of the most effective and\u00a0unique public awareness campaigns in recent years.\u00a0The premise of the show was that a terminally ill woman\u00a0would donate her kidney to the most worthy person\u00a0of a group of people needing kidney transplants.

Soon media across the Netherlands\u00a0and beyond were debating the ethics of waiting lists and\u00a0the propriety of turning organ donation into public entertainment. On June 1, 2007, when the show finally\u00a0aired, millions of viewers worldwide tuned in to watch.\nThe surprising twist to an already spectacular and\u00a0highly controversial program was that it was all a hoax.\u00a0Just before the alleged cancer patient was about to\u00a0choose the lucky recipient of her kidney, the host announced that the \u201ccancer patient\u201d was actually a hired\u00a0actor. The entire program had been staged to raise\u00a0awareness about the insufficient number of organ donors in the country. He then announced that the people\u00a0who were performing as competitors to receive a kidney\u00a0were, however, real patients awaiting kidney donors.\nWithin a day, 30,000 donor registration forms were\u00a0requested. A month after the show aired, 7,300 new donors\u00a0were registered by the Dutch donor registration. In\u00a0Denmark alone, 700 citizens registered as donors the day after the program was aired \u2014 fifteen times the average\u00a0on a regular Saturday.

But I knew I could be doing more. So\u00a0then I started winning bids, and disrupting it as\u00a0clearly as I could.[1]\nTim won about a dozen lots in a row \u2014 until the auctioneer\u00a0realized something was wrong, suspended the\u00a0proceedings, and had Tim arrested.\nAfter Obama took office, his administration investigated\u00a0the auction for \u201cirregularities,\u201d and a federal judge cancelled\u00a0the sales.

A full week of news and talk radio ensued, sparking widespread discussion about gender stereotypes.\nThe action was a response to a very dumb PR move Mattel had made nearly a year earlier, when it released a new talking Barbie that said \u201cMath is hard.\u201d Outraged feminists thrashed them in the press, and behind closed doors a small group of folks began plotting revenge. What else could Barbie say? One participant in the informal brainstorm sessions \u2014 an octogenarian Hungarian holocaust survivor who went by the nickname \u201cGyongi\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t care about Barbie: the problem for her was GI Joe. A quick trip to the toy store confirmed that GI Joe talked too, and a plot was hatched: all that was required to make these toys into gender-bending Trojan horses was a voice-box switcheroo. Armed with soldering irons, screwdrivers, epoxy and sweat, the Barbie Liberation Organization went to work.\nThe next step was to recruit other BLO members, who purchased the toys in different cities, and sent them in for surgery. Each toy was carefully removed from its packaging, \u201cfixed,\u201d and returned. \u201cShop droppers\u201d then put them right back on the store shelves they came from (without getting a refund, so nobody could call it stealing).\nBut this wasn\u2019t to be a simple spectacle, it was to be a media spectacle, so an elaborate press plan was hatched. Along with each repackaged toy they included a doctored instruction sheet, complete with the numbers of local and national press, and a voicemail number for the BLO. The idea was that kids would open their toys, parents would call the numbers, and the media would cover it.\nThe day before Christmas, the BLO sent out a press release claiming responsibility for the action. The hope was that on Christmas day, when the media started getting phone calls from real people who\u2019d gotten the toys, they\u2019d put two and two together.\nIn case even that didn\u2019t do the trick, the BLO built additional layers of redundancy into the media plan. They recruited two kids \u2014 one in San Diego, California, and one in Albany, New York \u2014 who were willing to put on a little show for the news cameras, thereby \u201cproving\u201d that the action was really happening. Lastly, they kept a stash of extra dolls on hand and stood ready to scramble to the toy stores nearest to any media who called their voicemail. When the media called, the BLO located the nearest store to the caller, got there as fast as they could, and put an altered toy on the shelf. On at least one occasion, BLO members were still in the store when the journalist arrived. They watched him find the toy, test it, and triumphantly purchase it \u2014 proof-positive of the power and reach of the Barbie Liberation Organization.\n\nBy Mike Bonanno","url":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/case\/barbie-liberation-organization\/","image":"http:\/\/beautifultrouble.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Beautiful Trouble\/CASE Barbie Liberation Organization\/CA_Barbie Liberation Organization_Barbie and Ken.jpg","links":[100184,100177,200225,200264,200231,200187,300204,100239,100148,200154,200182,200130,200180,200233,200199,200134,300258,300235]},{"id":505111,"type":4,"title":"Free Fare Movement (Movimento Passe Livre)","text":"The Free Fare Movement (Movimento Passe Livre) is an independent and nonpartisan social movement in Brazil that fights to change the current private transportation system to a free public transportation system available to everyone.
